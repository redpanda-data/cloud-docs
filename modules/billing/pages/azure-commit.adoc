= Use Azure Commitments
:description: Subscribe to Redpanda in Azure Marketplace with committed use.

You can subscribe to Redpanda Cloud through Azure Marketplace and use your existing marketplace billing and credits to quickly provision Dedicated clusters. View your bills and manage your subscription directly in the marketplace.

With a usage-based billing commitment, you sign up for a monthly or an annual minimum spend amount. Commitments are minimums: 

- If you use less than your committed amount, you still pay the minimum. Any unused amount on a monthly commitment rolls over to the next month until the end of your term. 
- If you use more than your committed amount, you can continue using Redpanda Cloud without interruption. You're charged for any additional usage until the end of your term.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you subscribe to Redpanda Cloud through Azure Marketplace, you can only create clusters on Azure.
