When you access Iceberg topics from a data lakehouse or other Iceberg-compatible tools, how you consume the data depends on the topic xref:manage:iceberg/about-iceberg-topics.adoc#enable-iceberg-integration[Iceberg mode] and whether you've registered a schema for the topic in the xref:manage:schema-reg/schema-reg-overview.adoc[Redpanda Schema Registry]. In either mode, you do not need to rely on complex ETL jobs or pipelines to access real-time data from Redpanda.
