For topics with Tiered Storage enabled, you can unmount a topic to safely detach it from a cluster and keep the topic data in the cluster's object storage bucket or container. You can remount the detached topic to the origin cluster, allowing you to hibernate a topic and free up system resources taken up by the topic.
