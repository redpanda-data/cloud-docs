Redpanda Cloud provides secure authentication for both users accessing the platform and services connecting to your clusters.

== User authentication

Redpanda provides user authentication to your Redpanda organization through email/password or single sign-on. 

=== Email

Redpanda Cloud can authenticate users with emails and passwords. Passwords are hashed (a one-way function that makes the original value unrecoverable, and effectively encrypted) and salted at rest using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt[bcrypt^].

=== Single sign-on

Redpanda Cloud can authenticate users with single sign-on (SSO) to an OIDC-based identity provider (IdP). Redpanda integrates with any OIDC-compliant IdP that supports discovery, including <<integrate-with-okta,Okta>>, <<integrate-with-microsoft-entra-id,Microsoft Entra ID>>, Auth0, Active Directory Federation Services (AD-FS), and JumpCloud. After SSO is enabled for an organization, new users in that organization can authenticate with SSO. 

You must integrate your IdP with Redpanda Cloud to use SSO. On the *Users* page, users with admin permission see a *Single sign-on* tab and can add connections for up to two different IdPs. Enter the client ID, client secret, and discovery URI for the IdP. (See your IdP documentation for these values. The discovery URI may be called something different, like the well known URL or the `issuer_url`.) 

By default, the connection is added in a disabled state. Edit the connection to enable it. You can choose to enable auto-enroll in the connection, which provides new users signing in from that IdP access to your Redpanda organization. When you enable auto-enroll, you select to assign a read, write, or admin role to users who log in with that IdP. Set up is different for most IdPs. 

CAUTION: Deleting an SSO connection also deletes all users attached to it. 

==== Integrate with Okta

To integrate with Okta, follow the https://help.okta.com/en-us/Content/Topics/Apps/Apps_App_Integration_Wizard_OIDC.htm[Okta documentation^] to create an application within Okta for Redpanda. The Redpanda callback location (that is, the redirect location where Okta sends the user) is the following:

```
https://auth.prd.cloud.redpanda.com/login/callback
```

Okta provides the following fields required for SSO configuration on the Redpanda *Users* page: `clientId`, `clientSecret`, and `discoveryUrl`. The discovery URL for Okta generally looks like the following (where `an_id` could be “default”):

[pass]
```
https://<orgname>.okta.com/oauth2/<an_id>/.well-known/openid-configuration
``` 

==== Integrate with Microsoft Entra ID

To integrate with Entra ID, follow the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/v2-protocols-oidc[Microsoft documentation^] to create an OIDC enterprise (Web) application:

. In the https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id[Entra App Gallery^], on the Create your own application page: 
.. Select *Register an application to integrate with Microsoft Entra ID*.
.. For the name of your app, enter `Redpanda Cloud`. 
.. Click *Create*.
. On the Register an application page: 
.. For Supported account types, select *Accounts in this organizational directory only (Redpanda only - Single tenant)*.
.. For Redirect URI, select *Web* platform with the Callback URL from Redpanda Cloud. To find the Callback URL in Redpanda Cloud, navigate to the *Users*: *Single sign-on* page, and click *Add connection*. Copy the *Callback URL*, and paste it into the Azure *Redirect URI* field. 
+
IMPORTANT: The platform type must be *Web*. Because Redpanda Cloud uses the OIDC Authorization Code flow with PKCE and a server-side callback, the app must be configured as Web (not SPA or mobile).
.. Click *Register*.
. On the Azure Enterprise applications page, you can now search for the Redpanda Cloud app to assign users access to Redpanda Cloud.
. On the Azure app for Redpanda Cloud, click *Endpoints*, and copy the *OpenID Connect metadata document URL* endpoint.
. In Redpanda Cloud, on the *Users*: *Single sign-on* page, paste that endpoint address into the *Discovery URI* field. Then, complete the SSO configuration:
.. For *Client ID*, copy and paste the *Application (client) ID* from the Azure app for Redpanda Cloud.
.. For *Client secret*, copy and paste the secret you get from adding a client secret on the Certificates & secrets page for the Azure app for Redpanda Cloud.
.. For *Realm*, enter your Entra ID tenant domain name.
.. Click *Save*.
.. On the Redpanda Cloud Users: Single sign-on page, edit your new Entra ID connection to enable single sign-on. 
+
Users with an email address with that realm (domain) can now access your Redpanda Cloud account. 
+
[NOTE]
====

* No additional claims required: Do not add optional claims or group claims to ID/Access tokens. Redpanda Cloud only relies on standard OIDC claims provided by your IdP.
* No API permissions required: You do not need Microsoft Graph or any other API permissions. Microsoft Graph `User.Read` may be listed (some tenants add it during app creation), but Redpanda Cloud performs OIDC sign-in only and does not call Microsoft Graph.
* First-login consent only: On first sign-in, users are prompted to consent to the standard OIDC scopes `openid`, `profile`, and `email`. After the first consent, users should not be prompted again unless consent is revoked or the app configuration changes.
====

===== Tips for Integrating Entra ID

If users are repeatedly prompted for consent or cannot sign in:

* Ensure the app is configured as Web with the exact Redirect URI from Redpanda Cloud.
* Remove any extra API permissions (for example, `Microsoft Graph: User.Read`).
* Avoid adding non-standard claims or scopes.


== Service authentication

Each Redpanda Cloud data plane runs its own dedicated agent,
which authenticates and connects against the control plane over a single TLS 1.2
encrypted TCP connection.

Different Redpanda APIs support different authentication methods: 

* Kafka API: Redpanda Cloud supports both SASL (over TLS 1.2) and <<mtls,mTLS>> authentication for Kafka clients connecting to Redpanda clusters over the TCP endpoint or listener.
* HTTP Proxy and Schema Registry: Redpanda Cloud supports HTTP Basic Authentication (encrypted over TLS 1.2) and <<mtls,mTLS>> for client authentication.

For AWS and GCP, you can simultaneously enable mTLS and SASL for Kafka API, and mTLS and Basic authentication for the HTTP APIs (HTTP Proxy and Schema Registry). If you enable both mTLS and SASL, Redpanda creates two distinct listeners: an mTLS listener operating on one port and a SASL listener operating on a different port.

The following features use IAM policies to generate
dynamic and short-lived credentials to interact with cloud provider APIs:

* Data plane agent
* Tiered Storage
* Redpanda Console
* Kafka Connect

xref:security:authorization/cloud-iam-policies.adoc[IAM policies] have constrained permissions so that each service can only
access or manage its own data plane-scoped resources, following the principle of
least privilege.

== Configure service authentication

Redpanda Cloud supports mTLS or SASL authentication for Kafka API, HTTP Proxy, and Schema Registry.

When you create a new cluster using the https://cloud.redpanda.com/[Cloud UI^], the cluster is enabled by default with SASL for Kafka API, and Basic authentication for HTTP Proxy and Schema Registry.

=== Requirements

NOTE: mTLS authentication is supported on AWS and GCP clusters only.

If you want to enable mTLS authentication:

* You must use the Cloud API to create a new mTLS-enabled cluster. 
* You must also use the Cloud API to update an existing cluster to switch to mTLS authentication for Kafka API.
* You can use the Cloud UI to update an existing cluster to switch to mTLS authentication for HTTP Proxy and Schema Registry only.
* To enable mTLS and SASL (or Basic authentication) simultaneously, you must use the Cloud API to create a new cluster or update an existing cluster.

To configure service authentication in your cluster using the Cloud API, you must have the following:

* A service account in your Redpanda organization. You must have administrative privileges to create a service account.
* Access to the link:/api/doc/cloud-controlplane/topic/topic-cloud-api-overview[Cloud API] to enable mTLS or both SASL and mTLS. You use the service account to obtain an access token. You then make a request to the Control Plane API, passing the access token in the authorization header.

=== Authenticate to the Cloud API

. Create a service account in your organization, if you haven't already. Go to the Service account tab of the https://cloud.redpanda.com/organization-iam?tab=service-accounts[Organization IAM^] page in the Redpanda Cloud UI and click *Create service account* to create a service account. Enter a name and description.
. Retrieve the client ID and secret by clicking *Copy ID* and *Copy Secret*. 
. Obtain an access token by making a `POST` request to `\https://auth.prd.cloud.redpanda.com/oauth/token` with the ID and secret in the request body. 
+
[,bash]

[[mtls]]
=== Enable mTLS authentication
:description: Use the Cloud API to enable mTLS for Kafka API, HTTP Proxy, and Schema Registry connections on your Redpanda cluster.

For clusters with mTLS authentication, Redpanda creates a dedicated mTLS-enabled listener for each API service (Kafka API, HTTP Proxy, or Schema Registry) where you've enabled this authentication method. After you enable mTLS, <<retrieve-api-endpoints,get the API endpoints>> and <<verify-mtls,verify that mTLS authentication is in effect>>. 

NOTE: If you enable mTLS authentication, you cannot disable it later.

==== Create a new cluster with mTLS enabled

. Follow the steps to create a resource group and network for xref:manage:api/cloud-byoc-controlplane-api.adoc#create-a-resource-group[BYOC] or xref:manage:api/cloud-dedicated-controlplane-api.adoc#create-a-resource-group[Dedicated], if you haven't already. You'll need the resource group ID and network ID to create a cluster in the next step.

. Make a link:/api/doc/cloud-controlplane/operation/operation-clusterservice_createcluster[`POST /v1/clusters`] request to create a new cluster with mTLS enabled.

NOTE: The following example enables mTLS for Kafka API. To enable mTLS for HTTP Proxy and Schema Registry, add the `http_proxy.mtls` and `schema_registry.mtls` fields to the request body. You can choose to enable mTLS for any combination of the three services.

To verify that mTLS is enabled for Kafka API, run the following `rpk` command without providing a security certificate or private key:

[,bash]
----
rpk cluster info --tls-enabled
----

You should get the following error:

```
unable to request metadata: remote error: tls: certificate required
```

[[consume-produce-mtls]]
When you consume, produce to, or manage topics using xref:ROOT:reference:rpk/rpk-topic/rpk-topic.adoc[`rpk`], you must provide a client certificate and private key. You may use the `--tls-cert` and `--tls-key` options, or xref:ROOT:reference:rpk/rpk-x-options.adoc[environment variables] with `rpk`.

[,bash]
----
rpk topic create test-topic --tls-enabled --tls-cert=/path/to/tls.crt --tls-key=/path/to/tls.key
----

=== Verify mTLS for HTTP Proxy and Schema Registry

To verify that mTLS is enabled for the HTTP Proxy and Schema Registry, run the following `curl` commands, without providing a security certificate or key:

[,bash]
----
# Run the following to verify HTTP Proxy
curl -u $USERNAME:$PASSWORD -k -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.kafka.json.v2+json" --sslv2 --http2 -d '{"records":[{"test":"hello"},{"test":"world"}]}' $HTTP_PROXY_MTLS_URL/topics/<topic-name>

# Run the following to verify Schema Registry
curl -u $USERNAME:$PASSWORD -k -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.schemaregistry.v1+json" $SCHEMA_REGISTRY_MTLS_URL/subjects/<subject-name>/versions/1
----

You should get an error indicating that the certificate is required.

To successfully connect to the HTTP Proxy and Schema Registry, you must provide a client certificate and private key. The following `curl` commands show example requests to mTLS-enabled endpoints using `test` as the username and `12345` as the password.

[,bash]
----
# HTTP Proxy
curl -u test:12345 -k --cert cert.pem --key key.pem -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.kafka.json.v2+json" --sslv2 --http2 https://pandaproxy-45f811b1.cge5asc6006u7fvep0q0.fmc.dev.cloud.redpanda.com:30082/topics

# Schema Registry
curl -u test:12345 -k --cert cert.pem --key key.pem https://schema-registry-15d24f32.cge5asc6006u7fvep0q0.fmc.dev.cloud.redpanda.com:30081/subjects/Kafka-value/versions/1
----

=== Verify SASL

To verify that SASL is enabled for Kafka API, run the following `rpk` command:

[,bash]
----
rpk topic create test-topic --tls-enabled --user <username> --password <password>
----

The command should succeed, and you should be able to create a topic named `test-topic`.
