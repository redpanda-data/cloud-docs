=== Schema Registry management

In the Redpanda Console UI, you can xref:manage:schema-reg/schema-reg-ui.adoc[perform Schema Registry operations], such as registering a schema, creating a new version of it, and configuring compatibility. The **Schema Registry** page lists verified schemas, including their serialization format and versions. Select an individual schema to see which topics it applies to.

=== Maintenance windows

With maintenance windows, you have greater flexibility to plan upgrades to your cluster. By default, Redpanda Cloud upgrades take place on Tuesdays. Optionally, on the **Cluster settings** page, you can select a window of specific off-hours for your business for Redpanda to apply updates. All times are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Updates may start at any time during that window.
