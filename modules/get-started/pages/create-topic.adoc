:description: Learn how to create a topic for a Redpanda Cloud cluster.
:page-aliases: cloud:create-topic.adoc



Topics provide a way to organize events. After creating a cluster, you can create a topic in it. 

Topic properties are populated from information stored in the broker. Redpanda features, such as Tiered Storage, are enabled and configured by default in Redpanda Cloud. For Dedicated and BYOC clusters, you can optionally overwrite some settings.
