=== Serverless Standard

Serverless Standard is the fastest and easiest way to start data streaming. With Serverless clusters, you host your data in Redpanda's VPC, and Redpanda handles automatic scaling, provisioning, operations, and maintenance. This is a production-ready deployment option with a cluster available instantly. There is no base cost for Serverless Standard, and with pay-as-you-go billing after the free trial, you only pay for what you consume. You can view detailed billing activity for each cluster and edit payment methods on the *Billing* page. 

==== Sign up for Serverless Standard

To start using Serverless Standard, https://redpanda.com/try-redpanda/cloud-trial#serverless[sign up for a free trial^]. New trials receive $100 (USD) in free credits to spend in the first 14 days. This should be enough to run Redpanda with reasonable throughput. No credit card is required for a trial. To continue using your Serverless cluster after the free trial expires, add a credit card and pay as you go. 

You can also subscribe to Redpanda Cloud through xref:billing:aws-pay-as-you-go.adoc[AWS Marketplace] and quickly provision Serverless clusters. New subscriptions receive $300 (USD) in free credits to spend in the first 30 days. AWS Marketplace charges for anything beyond $300, unless you cancel the subscription. After your free credits have been used, you can continue using your cluster without any commitment, only paying for what you consume and canceling anytime. 

NOTE: Serverless Standard is currently in a limited availability (LA) release with xref:get-started:cluster-types/serverless.adoc#serverless-standard-usage-limits[usage limits]. 

=== Serverless Pro

Serverless Pro is similar to Serverless Standard, but it provides higher usage limits and Enterprise support. 

You host your data in Redpanda's VPC, and Redpanda handles automatic scaling, provisioning, operations, and maintenance. This is a production-ready deployment option with a cluster available instantly. A payment method is required for Serverless Pro. With pay-as-you-go billing, you only pay for what you consume. You can view detailed billing activity for each cluster and edit payment methods on the *Billing* page. 

==== Sign up for Serverless Pro

To start using Serverless Pro, contact https://redpanda.com/try-redpanda?section=enterprise-trial[Redpanda Sales^]. With this subscription, you get immediate access to Enterprise support. 

You can also subscribe to Redpanda Cloud through xref:billing:aws-pay-as-you-go.adoc[AWS Marketplace] and quickly provision Serverless clusters. New subscriptions receive $300 (USD) in free credits to spend in the first 30 days. AWS Marketplace charges for anything beyond $300, unless you cancel the subscription. After your free credits have been used, you can continue using your cluster without any commitment, only paying for what you consume and canceling anytime. 

With AWS Marketplace sign up, you do not have immediate access to Enterprise support, only the https://redpandacommunity.slack.com/[Community Slack^] channel. To access your Enterprise support, contact https://support.redpanda.com/hc/en-us/requests/new[Redpanda Support^]. 

NOTE: Serverless Pro is currently in a limited availability (LA) release with xref:get-started:cluster-types/serverless-pro.adoc#serverless-pro-usage-limits[usage limits]. 

=== Dedicated Cloud

With Dedicated clusters, you host your data on Redpanda cloud resources (AWS, GCP, or Azure), and Redpanda handles provisioning, operations, and maintenance. Dedicated clusters are single-tenant deployments that support private networking (for example, VPC peering to talk over private IPs) for better data isolation.
When you create a Dedicated cluster, you select the supported xref:reference:tiers/dedicated-tiers.adoc[tier] that meets your compute and storage needs. 

==== Sign up for Dedicated

Subscribe to Redpanda Cloud on the xref:billing:aws-pay-as-you-go.adoc[AWS Marketplace] to quickly provision Dedicated clusters. New subscriptions receive $300 (USD) in free credits to spend in the first 30 days. AWS Marketplace charges for anything beyond $300, unless you cancel the subscription. After your free credits have been used, you can continue using your cluster without any commitment, only paying for what you consume and canceling anytime. 

Alternatively, you can contact https://redpanda.com/try-redpanda?section=enterprise-trial[Redpanda sales^] to request a private offer for monthly or annual committed use. With a usage-based billing commitment, you sign up for a monthly or an annual minimum spend amount through xref:billing:aws-commit.adoc[AWS Marketplace], xref:billing:azure-commit.adoc[Azure Marketplace], or xref:billing:gcp-commit.adoc[Google Cloud Marketplace]. You can then provision Dedicated clusters in Redpanda Cloud, and you can view invoices and manage your subscription in the marketplace.

=== Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC)

With BYOC clusters, you deploy Redpanda in your own cloud (AWS, Azure, or GCP), and all data is
contained in your own environment. This provides an additional layer of security and isolation. (See <<BYOC architecture>>.) When you create a BYOC cluster, you select the supported xref:reference:tiers/byoc-tiers.adoc[tier] that meets your compute and storage needs. Redpanda handles provisioning, operations, and maintenance. 

NOTE: With standard BYOC clusters, Redpanda manages security policies and resources for your VPC or VNet, including subnetworks, IAM roles, and storage buckets/accounts. A Bring Your Own Virtual Private Cloud (BYOVPC) cluster allows you to deploy the Redpanda glossterm:data plane[] into your existing VPC/VNet and take full control of managing the networking lifecycle. Compared to standard BYOC, BYOVPC provides more security, but the configuration is more complex. See <<Shared responsibility model>>.

The BYOC infrastructure that Redpanda manages should not be used to deploy any other workloads.

==== Sign up for BYOC

To start using BYOC, contact https://redpanda.com/try-redpanda?section=enterprise-trial[Redpanda sales^] to request a private offer. You are billed directly or through Google Cloud Marketplace or AWS Marketplace. 

== Serverless vs Dedicated/BYOC

Serverless clusters (Standard or Pro) are a good fit for the following use cases:

* Starter and growing workloads
* Spiky workloads (that is, development environments, systems that only occasionally get busy, or workloads that come and go)
* Fast and dynamic cluster creation: you can use a Serverless cluster as an isolated container for topics

With Serverless (and for Dedicated when procured through the AWS Marketplace), you only pay for what you consume, without any commitment. A cluster is created instantly, so you can surface it in your applications (for example, for tenant isolation). If your workload increases, you can migrate it to a Dedicated or BYOC cluster.

Consider Dedicated or BYOC if you need more control over the deployment or if you have workloads with consistently-high throughput. Dedicated and BYOC clusters offer the following features:

* Private networking
* Single-zone or multi-zone availability. A multi-zone cluster provides higher resiliency in the event of a failure in one of the zones. 
* Ability to export metrics to a 3rd-party monitoring system
* Kafka Connect
* Higher limits and quotas. See xref:reference:tiers/dedicated-tiers.adoc[Dedicated usage tiers] and xref:reference:tiers/byoc-tiers.adoc[BYOC usage tiers] compared to xref:get-started:cluster-types/serverless.adoc#serverless-standard-usage-limits[Serverless Standard limits] and xref:get-started:cluster-types/serverless-pro.adoc#serverless-pro-usage-limits[Serverless Pro limits].

== Shared responsibility model

The Redpanda Cloud shared responsibility model lists the security ownership areas for Redpanda and customers. Responsibilities depend on the type of deployment.

== Redpanda Connect and Kafka Connect

xref:develop:connect/about.adoc[Redpanda Connect] is integrated into Redpanda Cloud and available as a fully-managed service. Choose from a range of connectors, processors, and other components to quickly build and deploy streaming data pipelines or AI applications from the Cloud UI or using the pass:a,m[xref:{tag-pipeline-service}[Data Plane API\]]. Comprehensive metrics, monitoring, and per pipeline scaling are also available. To start using Redpanda Connect, xref:develop:connect/connect-quickstart.adoc[try this quickstart].

xref:develop:managed-connectors/index.adoc[Kafka Connect] is automatically enabled on AWS and GCP clusters. With this, there is a node running for Kafka Connect even if connectors are not used. To enable Kafka Connect on Azure clusters, see xref:get-started:cluster-types/byoc/azure/create-byoc-cluster-azure.adoc#enable-kafka-connect[Enable Kafka Connect].

== Maintenance windows

Redpanda runs maintenance and upgrade operations on clusters in a rolling fashion, accompanied by a series of health checks, so there is no disruption to the availability of your service. As part of the Kafka protocol, recycling nodes cause client connections to be restarted. All mainstream client libraries support automatic reconnections for this.

By default, Redpanda Cloud may run maintenance operations on any day at any time. You can override this default and schedule a specific maintenance window on the *Cluster settings* page. A *Scheduled* maintenance window requires Redpanda Cloud to run operations on the day and time specified. Maintenance windows typically take six hours. All operations begin during the maintenance window, but some operations may complete after the window ends. All times are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

TIP: Redpanda Cloud maintenance cycles always start on Tuesdays. Clusters scheduled on Tuesdays are updated first, and clusters scheduled on Mondays are updated last. Keep this in mind when sequencing updates for multiple clusters.

== Redpanda Cloud architecture

When you sign up for a Redpanda account, Redpanda creates an organization for you. Your organization contains all your Redpanda resources, including your clusters and networks. Within your organization, Redpanda creates a default resource group to contain your resources. You can rename this resource group, and you can create more resource groups. For example, you may want different resource groups for production and testing. 

For high availability, Redpanda Cloud uses a control plane and data plane architecture. 

* *Control plane*: This is where most cluster management, operations, and maintenance takes place. The control plane enforces rules in the data plane.

* *Data plane*: This is where your cluster lives. The term _data plane_ is used interchangeably with _cluster_. 

* *Agent*: Redpanda uses an agent to manage the data plane from the control plane.

Clusters are configured and maintained in the control plane, but they remain available even if the network connection to the control plane is lost.

NOTE: In the user interface, when you're at the organization (org) level or the resource group level, but you haven't yet selected a cluster, you're in the control plane. This is where you can select, create, and delete clusters, resource groups, and networks. When you're at the cluster level working with topics, consumer groups, and connectors, you're in the data plane.

=== BYOC architecture

The following diagram shows a BYOC architecture, where you deploy the data plane in your own VPC. All network connections into the data plane take place through
either a public endpoint or a VPC peering network connection. Sensitive data and credentials never leave the data plane. 

image::shared:d_c_plane.png[Data plane and control plane]

include::get-started:partial$no-access.adoc[]

A BYOC cluster is initially set up from the control plane. This is a two-step process performed by `rpk cloud byoc apply`:

. You bootstrap a virtual machine (VM) in your VPC. 
+
This VM spins up the agent and the required infrastructure. Redpanda assigns the necessary IAM policies required to run the agent and configures workload identity. That is, it configures independent IAM roles for each workload, with only the permissions each workload requires. 

. The agent communicates with the control plane to pull the cluster specifications. 
+
After the agent is up and running, it connects to the control plane and starts dequeuing and applying cluster specifications that provision, configure, and maintain clusters. The agent is in constant communication with the control plane,
receiving and applying cluster specifications and exchanging cluster metadata. Agents are authenticated and authorized through opaque and ephemeral tokens, and
they have dedicated job queues in the control plane. Agents also manage VPC peering networks. 
+
image::shared:byoc_apply.png[cloud_byoc_apply]

NOTE: To create a Redpanda cluster in your virtual private cloud (VPC), follow the instructions in the Redpanda Cloud UI. The UI contains the parameters necessary to successfully run `rpk cloud byoc apply` with your cloud provider. 

== Redpanda Cloud vs Self-Managed feature compatibility

Because Redpanda Cloud is a fully-managed service that provides maintenance, data and partition balancing, upgrades, and recovery, much of the cluster maintenance required for Self-Managed users is not necessary for Redpanda Cloud users. Also, Redpanda Cloud is opinionated about Kafka configurations. For example, automatic topic creation is disabled. Some systems expect the Kafka service to automatically create topics when a message is produced to a topic that doesn't exist. (You can create topics in Redpanda Cloud on the *Topics* page or with `rpk topic create`.)

New clusters in Redpanda Cloud generally include functionality added in Self-Managed versions immediately. Existing clusters include new functionality when they get upgraded to the latest version. 

Redpanda Cloud deployments do not support the following functionality available in Redpanda Self-Managed deployments:

- Integration with Apache Iceberg. For private beta access on BYOC, contact https://support.redpanda.com/hc/en-us/requests/new[Redpanda Support^].
- Data transforms. For private beta access, contact https://support.redpanda.com/hc/en-us/requests/new[Redpanda Support^].
- Remote Read Replicas. This is in beta for Redpanda Cloud.
- Kafka API OIDC authentication. However, Redpanda Cloud does support xref:security:cloud-authentication.adoc#single-sign-on[SSO to the Redpanda Cloud UI].
- Admin API.
- FIPS-compliance mode.
- Kerberos authentication.
- Redpanda debug bundles.
- Redpanda Console topic documentation.
- Configuring access to object storage with customer-managed encryption key.
- Kubernetes Helm chart and Redpanda Operator functionality.
- The following `rpk` commands:
 
** `rpk cluster config`
** `rpk cluster health`
** `rpk cluster license`
** `rpk cluster maintenance`
** `rpk cluster partitions`
** `rpk cluster self-test`
** `rpk cluster storage`
** `rpk connect` 
** `rpk container` 
** `rpk debug` 
** `rpk iotune`
** `rpk redpanda`
** `rpk topic describe-storage` (All other `rpk topic` commands are supported on both Redpanda Cloud and Self Managed.)
** `rpk transform` (This is in beta for Redpanda Cloud.)
** `rpk generate app` (This is supported in Serverless clusters only.)
+
NOTE: The `rpk cloud` commands are not supported in Self-Managed deployments.
