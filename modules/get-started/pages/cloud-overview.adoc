:page-aliases: cloud:dedicated-byoc.adoc, deploy:deployment-option/cloud/dedicated-byoc.adoc, deploy:deployment-option/cloud/cloud-overview.adoc

Redpanda Cloud is a complete data streaming and agentic data plane platform delivered as a fully-managed service. It provides automated upgrades and patching, data balancing, and support while continuously monitoring your clusters and underlying infrastructure to meet strict performance, availability, reliability, and security requirements. All Redpanda Cloud clusters are deployed with an integrated glossterm:Redpanda Console[], and all clusters have access to unlimited retention and 300+ data connectors with xref:develop:connect/about.adoc[Redpanda Connect].

== Redpanda Agentic Data Plane (ADP)

Redpanda ADP is an enterprise-grade infrastructure for building, deploying, and managing AI agents at scale. Redpanda ADP provides unified governance, observability, and security for agentic applications while leveraging Redpanda's streaming and analytical foundation.

NOTE: The Agentic Data Plane is supported on BYOC clusters running with AWS and Redpanda version 25.3 and later.

Redpanda ADP is built on open standards and protocols, allowing you to pick and choose components that fit your needs. Integrate with existing agent frameworks, data processing systems, or custom code. It includes the following key components:

* **glossterm:AI agent[,AI agents]**: Deploy declarative agents or bring your own agent frameworks (such as LangChain or LlamaIndex). Build multi-agent systems where specialized glossterm:subagent[,sub-agents] handle specific responsibilities, following single-responsibility principles.
* **glossterm:MCP server[,MCP servers]**: Build lightweight data and action interfaces using xref:develop:connect/about.adoc[Redpanda Connect] or your own hosted MCP servers. Connect to hundreds of data sources (databases, cloud storage, APIs) and enforce fine-grained policies that programmatically prevent prompt injection and SQL injection attacks. MCP servers are extremely lightweight, with OIDC-based access control and real-time debugging capabilities.
* **AI Gateway**: Manage large language model (LLM) provider access with cost controls, rate limiting, intelligent routing, and failover support across multiple providers.
//* **Catalog**: Maintain a centralized repository of agents, MCP servers, tools, and policies. Share components across teams and enforce organization-wide standards.

=== Enterprise capabilities for AI agents

Redpanda ADP addresses critical enterprise requirements for AI agent deployments:

*Security by design*: MCP servers enforce policies at the tool level, programmatically preventing prompt injection, SQL injection, and other agent-based attacks. Policy enforcement is deterministic and controlled. Agents cannot bypass security constraints even through creative prompting.

*Unified authorization*: All components use OIDC-based authentication with an "on-behalf-of" authorization model. When a user invokes an agent, the agent inherits the intersection of its own permissions and the user's permissions, ensuring proper data access scoping.

*Complete observability*: Redpanda ADP provides two levels of inspection: execution logs (glossterm:transcript[,transcripts]) capture every agent action with 100% sampling using OpenTelemetry standards, while real-time debugging tools allow inspection of individual MCP server calls. Traces span across services and go as deep as needed, down to individual tool invocations with full timing data. View detailed agent actions in Redpanda Console and replay data for agent evaluations.

*Compliance and audit*: For industries requiring multi-year audit trails, Redpanda ADP records every agent action and data source used in decision-making. Execution logs are stored in Redpanda topics and can be materialized to Iceberg tables for long-term retention and analysis.

=== Use cases

Organizations can use Redpanda ADP to:

* *Automate operational workflows*: Create specialized agents for building management, infrastructure monitoring, compliance reporting, and other domain-specific tasks
* *Monitor manufacturing and operations*: Deploy multi-agent systems that analyze factory machine telemetry in real-time, detect anomalies, search equipment manuals, and create maintenance tickets automatically. Use data aggregation patterns (like tumbling windows) to process high-volume sensor data before sending insights to agents.
* *Extend enterprise productivity tools*: Integrate Microsoft Copilot or other workplace agents with internal data sources and systems that are otherwise inaccessible

=== Serverless

Serverless is the fastest and easiest way to start data streaming. With Serverless clusters, you host your data in Redpanda's VPC, and Redpanda handles automatic scaling, provisioning, operations, and maintenance. This is a production-ready deployment option with a cluster available instantly, and you only pay for what you consume. 

[NOTE]
====
* Serverless on GCP is currently in a glossterm:beta[] release.

==== Sign up for Serverless

include::get-started:partial$get-started-serverless.adoc[] 

=== Dedicated

With Dedicated clusters, you host your data on Redpanda Cloud resources (AWS, GCP, or Azure), and Redpanda handles provisioning, operations, and maintenance. When you create a Dedicated cluster, you select the supported xref:reference:tiers/dedicated-tiers.adoc[tier] that meets your compute and storage needs.

=== Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC)

With BYOC clusters, the Redpanda data plane (including Redpanda ADP components and Redpanda brokers) deploys into your existing VPC or VNet, ensuring all data remains in your environment.

With BYOC clusters, you deploy the Redpanda glossterm:data plane[] into your existing VPC (for AWS and GCP) or VNet (for Azure), and all data is
contained in your own environment. This provides an additional layer of security and isolation. (See xref:get-started:byoc-arch.adoc[].) Redpanda manages provisioning, monitoring, upgrades, and security policies, and it manages required resources in your VPC or VNet, including subnets (subnetworks in GCP), IAM roles, and object storage resources (for example, S3 buckets or Azure Storage accounts). 

==== Bring Your Own VPC/VNet (BYOVPC/BYOVNet) 

With BYOVPC/BYOVNet clusters, you take full control of the networking lifecycle. Compared to standard BYOC, BYOVPC/BYOVNet provides more security, but the configuration is more complex. See the xref:get-started:cloud-overview.adoc#shared-responsibility-model[shared responsibility model] to understand what you manage versus what Redpanda manages.

The BYOC infrastructure that Redpanda manages should not be used to deploy any other workloads.

For details about the control plane - data plane framework in BYOC, see xref:get-started:byoc-arch.adoc[BYOC architecture].

==== Sign up for BYOC

To start using BYOC, contact https://redpanda.com/try-redpanda?section=enterprise-trial[Redpanda sales^] to request a private offer with possible discounts. You are billed directly or through Google Cloud Marketplace or AWS Marketplace. 

=== Serverless vs BYOC/Dedicated

Serverless clusters are a good fit for the following use cases:

* Quick setup for development or testing
* Variable or unpredictable traffic patterns
* No upfront cost commitment
* Isolated environments for different applications

Consider BYOC or Dedicated if you need more control over the deployment or if you have workloads with consistently-high throughput. BYOC and Dedicated clusters offer the following features:

* Redpanda Agentic Data Plane (ADP): BYOC only
* Multiple availability zones (AZs). A multi-AZ cluster provides higher resiliency in the event of a failure in one of the zones. 
* Role-based access control (RBAC) in the data plane
* Kafka Connect
* Higher limits and quotas. See xref:reference:tiers/byoc-tiers.adoc[BYOC usage tiers] and xref:reference:tiers/dedicated-tiers.adoc[Dedicated usage tiers] compared to xref:get-started:cluster-types/serverless.adoc#serverless-usage-limits[Serverless limits].

== Redpanda Cloud architecture

When you sign up for a Redpanda account, Redpanda creates an organization for you. Your organization contains all your Redpanda resources, including your clusters and networks. Within your organization, Redpanda creates a default resource group to contain your resources. You can rename this resource group, and you can create more resource groups. For example, you may want different resource groups for production and testing.

[TIP]
====

For more detailed information about the Redpanda platform, see xref:get-started:intro-to-events.adoc[] and xref:get-started:architecture.adoc[].
==== 

== Shared responsibility model

The Redpanda Cloud shared responsibility model lists the security areas owned by Redpanda and the security areas owned by customers. Responsibilities depend on the type of deployment.

== Redpanda Connect and Kafka Connect

xref:develop:connect/about.adoc[Redpanda Connect] lets you compose pipelines from a rich library of inputs, processors, and outputs with strong metrics, logging, and per-pipeline scaling. To try it, see the xref:develop:connect/connect-quickstart.adoc[quickstart].

xref:develop:managed-connectors/index.adoc[Kafka Connect] is disabled by default on all new clusters. To unlock this feature for your BYOC or Dedicated cluster, contact https://support.redpanda.com/hc/en-us/requests/new[Redpanda Support^]. When enabled, a Kafka Connect node runs even if no connectors are configured.

=== Redpanda Connect vs data transforms

xref:develop:data-transforms/how-transforms-work.adoc[Data transforms] (Wasm) provide lightweight, per-record changes between Redpanda topics with minimal latency. Transforms run inside the broker, map one input topic to one or more output topics, and are intentionally sandboxed (no external network or disk access). They're ideal for validation, redaction, format/schema conversion, and simple routing.

[cols="1,2,2",options="header",stripes=none]
|===
|  | Data transforms | Redpanda Connect

| Best for
| Simple, stateless, per-record normalization inside Redpanda
| Enrichment/lookup with external services; multi-stage flows

| External I/O
| Not permitted (sandboxed)
| Native (HTTP/database/object storage)

| Topology
| 1:1 or 1:N (no cross-topic fan-in)
| Fan-in and fan-out; multi-step pipelines

| Ordering
| Preserves per-partition order
| Per-partition order can be preserved; configure parallelism and batching accordingly

| Scale & isolation
| Shares broker CPU/memory; best for lightweight operations
| Scales independently; isolates heavy work from brokers

| Failure handling
| You code routing/error behavior
| Built-in retries/backoff and DLQ patterns
|===

[TIP]
====
* Use data transforms for simple, in-broker, per-record changes with minimal latency.
* Use Redpanda Connect if your pipeline must talk to external systems (HTTP services, databases, cloud storage), or when you need advanced flow control, such as batching and windowed processing. 
====

== Redpanda Cloud vs Self-Managed feature compatibility

Because Redpanda Cloud is a fully-managed service that provides maintenance, data and partition balancing, upgrades, and recovery, much of the cluster maintenance required for Self-Managed users is not necessary for Redpanda Cloud users. Also, Redpanda Cloud is opinionated about Kafka configurations. For example, automatic topic creation is disabled. Some systems expect the Kafka service to automatically create topics when a message is produced to a topic that doesn't exist. (You can enable this for BYOC and Dedicated clusters with the `auto_create_topics_enabled` cluster property.)

New clusters in Redpanda Cloud generally include functionality added in Self-Managed versions immediately. Existing clusters include new functionality when they get upgraded to the latest version. 

Redpanda Cloud deployments do not support the following functionality available in Redpanda Self-Managed deployments:

- Kafka API OIDC authentication. However, Redpanda Cloud does support xref:security:cloud-authentication.adoc#single-sign-on[SSO to the Redpanda Cloud UI].
- Admin API.
- FIPS-compliance mode.
- Kerberos authentication.
- Redpanda debug bundles.
- Redpanda Console topic documentation.
- Manual deserialization of Schema Registry
- Configuring access to object storage with customer-managed encryption key.
- Kubernetes Helm chart and Redpanda Operator functionality.
- The following `rpk` commands:
 
** `rpk cluster health`
** `rpk cluster license`
** `rpk cluster maintenance`
** `rpk cluster partitions`
** `rpk cluster self-test`
** `rpk cluster storage restore` (But `rpk cluster storage` and subcommands for mountable topics are supported in BYOC and Dedicated clusters)
** `rpk connect` 
** `rpk container` 
** `rpk debug` 
** `rpk generate app` (This is supported in Serverless clusters only.)
** `rpk iotune`
** `rpk redpanda`
** `rpk topic describe-storage` (All other `rpk topic` commands are supported on both Redpanda Cloud and Self Managed.)
+
NOTE: The `rpk cloud` commands are not supported in Self-Managed deployments.
