Redpanda Cloud is a complete data streaming platform delivered as a fully-managed service. It provides automated upgrades and patching, data balancing, and support while continuously monitoring your clusters and underlying infrastructure to meet strict performance, availability, reliability, and security requirements. All Redpanda Cloud clusters are deployed with an integrated glossterm:Redpanda Console[], and all clusters have access to unlimited retention and 300+ data connectors with xref:develop:connect/about.adoc[Redpanda Connect].

TIP: For more detailed information about the Redpanda platform, see xref:get-started:intro-to-events.adoc[] and xref:get-started:architecture.adoc[].

== Redpanda Cloud cluster types

Redpanda Cloud offers three fully-managed cloud deployment options, each designed for different use cases:

* **<<Serverless>>**: Fastest way to get started with automatic scaling and pay-as-you-go billing
* **<<Dedicated>>**: Production clusters in Redpanda's cloud with enhanced isolation
* **<<Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC)>>**: Maximum control and security by deploying in your own cloud environment

=== Serverless

Serverless is the fastest and easiest way to start data streaming. With Serverless clusters, you host your data in Redpanda's VPC, and Redpanda handles automatic scaling, provisioning, operations, and maintenance. This is a production-ready deployment option with a cluster available instantly, and with pay-as-you-go billing after the free trial, you only pay for what you consume. You can view detailed billing activity for each cluster and edit payment methods on the *Billing* page. 

NOTE: Serverless is currently in a limited availability (LA) release with xref:get-started:cluster-types/serverless.adoc#serverless-usage-limits[usage limits].

==== Sign up for Serverless

include::get-started:partial$get-started-serverless.adoc[] 

=== Dedicated

With Dedicated clusters, you host your data on Redpanda Cloud resources (AWS, GCP, or Azure), and Redpanda handles provisioning, operations, and maintenance. Dedicated clusters are single-tenant deployments that support private networking (for example, VPC peering to talk over private IPs) for better data isolation.
When you create a Dedicated cluster, you select the supported xref:reference:tiers/dedicated-tiers.adoc[tier] that meets your compute and storage needs.

=== Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC)

With BYOC clusters, you deploy the Redpanda glossterm:data plane[] into your existing VPC (for AWS and GCP) or VNet (for Azure), and all data is
contained in your own environment. This provides an additional layer of security and isolation. (See xref:get-started:byoc-arch.adoc[].) Redpanda manages provisioning, monitoring, upgrades, and security policies, and it manages required resources in your VPC or VNet, including subnets (subnetworks in GCP), IAM roles, and object storage resources (for example, S3 buckets or Azure Storage accounts). 

==== Bring Your Own VPC/VNet (BYOVPC/BYOVNet) 

With BYOVPC/BYOVNet clusters, you take full control of the networking lifecycle. Compared to standard BYOC, BYOVPC/BYOVNet provides more security, but the configuration is more complex. See the xref:get-started:cloud-overview.adoc#shared-responsibility-model[shared responsibility model] to understand what you manage versus what Redpanda manages.

The BYOC infrastructure that Redpanda manages should not be used to deploy any other workloads.

==== Sign up for BYOC

To start using BYOC, contact https://redpanda.com/try-redpanda?section=enterprise-trial[Redpanda sales^] to request a private offer with possible discounts. You are billed directly or through Google Cloud Marketplace or AWS Marketplace. 

=== Serverless vs BYOC/Dedicated

Serverless clusters are a good fit for the following use cases:

* Quick setup for development or testing
* Variable or unpredictable traffic patterns
* No upfront cost commitment
* Isolated environments for different applications

Consider BYOC or Dedicated if you need more control over the deployment or if you have workloads with consistently-high throughput. BYOC and Dedicated clusters offer the following features:

* Private networking
* Multiple availability zones (AZs). A multi-AZ cluster provides higher resiliency in the event of a failure in one of the zones. 
* Ability to export Redpanda metrics to a third-party monitoring system
* Kafka Connect
* Higher limits and quotas. See xref:reference:tiers/byoc-tiers.adoc[BYOC usage tiers] and xref:reference:tiers/dedicated-tiers.adoc[Dedicated usage tiers] compared to xref:get-started:cluster-types/serverless.adoc#serverless-usage-limits[Serverless limits].

== Redpanda Cloud architecture

When you sign up for a Redpanda account, Redpanda creates an organization for you. Your organization contains all your Redpanda resources, including your clusters and networks. Within your organization, Redpanda creates a default resource group to contain your resources. You can rename this resource group, and you can create more resource groups. For example, you may want different resource groups for production and testing.

For details about the control plane - data plane framework in BYOC, see xref:get-started:byoc-arch.adoc[BYOC architecture].

== Shared responsibility model

The Redpanda Cloud shared responsibility model lists the security areas owned by Redpanda and the security areas owned by customers. Responsibilities depend on the type of deployment.

== Redpanda Connect and Kafka Connect

xref:develop:connect/about.adoc[Redpanda Connect] lets you compose pipelines from a rich library of inputs, processors, and outputs with strong metrics, logging, and per-pipeline scaling. To try it, see the xref:develop:connect/connect-quickstart.adoc[quickstart].

xref:develop:managed-connectors/index.adoc[Kafka Connect] is disabled by default on all new clusters. To unlock this feature for your BYOC or Dedicated cluster, contact https://support.redpanda.com/hc/en-us/requests/new[Redpanda Support^]. When enabled, a Kafka Connect node runs even if no connectors are configured.

=== Redpanda Connect vs data transforms

xref:develop:data-transforms/how-transforms-work.adoc[Data transforms] (Wasm) provide lightweight, per-record changes between Redpanda topics with minimal latency. Transforms run inside the broker, map one input topic to one or more output topics, and are intentionally sandboxed (no external network or disk access). They're ideal for validation, redaction, format/schema conversion, and simple routing.

[cols="1,2,2",options="header",stripes=none]
|===
|  | Data transforms | Redpanda Connect

| Best for
| Simple, stateless, per-record normalization inside Redpanda
| Enrichment/lookup with external services; multi-stage flows

| External I/O
| Not permitted (sandboxed)
| Native (HTTP/DB/object storage)

| Topology
| 1:1 or 1:N (no cross-topic fan-in)
| Fan-in and fan-out; multi-step pipelines

| Ordering
| Preserves per-partition order
| Per-partition order can be preserved; configure parallelism and batching accordingly

| Scale & isolation
| Shares broker CPU/memory. Best for lightweight operations
| Scales independently; isolates heavy work from brokers

| Failure handling
| You code routing/error behavior
| Built-in retries/backoff and DLQ patterns
|===

[TIP]
====
* Use data transforms for simple, in-broker, per-record changes with minimal latency.
* Use Redpanda Connect if your pipeline must talk to external systems (HTTP services, databases, cloud storage), or when you need advanced flow control, such as batching and windowed processing. 
====

== Redpanda Cloud vs Self-Managed feature compatibility

Because Redpanda Cloud is a fully-managed service that provides maintenance, data and partition balancing, upgrades, and recovery, much of the cluster maintenance required for Self-Managed users is not necessary for Redpanda Cloud users. Also, Redpanda Cloud is opinionated about Kafka configurations. For example, automatic topic creation is disabled. Some systems expect the Kafka service to automatically create topics when a message is produced to a topic that doesn't exist. (You can create topics in Redpanda Cloud on the *Topics* page or with `rpk topic create`.)

New clusters in Redpanda Cloud generally include functionality added in Self-Managed versions immediately. Existing clusters include new functionality when they get upgraded to the latest version. 

Redpanda Cloud deployments do not support the following functionality available in Redpanda Self-Managed deployments:

- Kafka API OIDC authentication. However, Redpanda Cloud does support xref:security:cloud-authentication.adoc#single-sign-on[SSO to the Redpanda Cloud UI].
- Admin API.
- FIPS-compliance mode.
- Kerberos authentication.
- Redpanda debug bundles.
- Redpanda Console topic documentation.
- Manual deserialization of Schema Registry
- Configuring access to object storage with customer-managed encryption key.
- Kubernetes Helm chart and Redpanda Operator functionality.
- The following `rpk` commands:
 
** `rpk cluster health`
** `rpk cluster license`
** `rpk cluster maintenance`
** `rpk cluster partitions`
** `rpk cluster self-test`
** `rpk cluster storage restore` (But `rpk cluster storage` and subcommands for mountable topics are supported in BYOC and Dedicated clusters)
** `rpk connect` 
** `rpk container` 
** `rpk debug` 
** `rpk generate app` (This is supported in Serverless clusters only.)
** `rpk iotune`
** `rpk redpanda`
** `rpk topic describe-storage` (All other `rpk topic` commands are supported on both Redpanda Cloud and Self Managed.)
+
NOTE: The `rpk cloud` commands are not supported in Self-Managed deployments.
