Redpanda Cloud is a complete data streaming platform delivered as a fully-managed service with automated upgrades and patching, data and partition balancing, and 24x7 support. It continuously monitors and maintains your clusters along with the underlying infrastructure to meet strict performance, availability, reliability, and security requirements. All Redpanda Cloud clusters are deployed with an integrated glossterm:Redpanda Console[].

TIP: For more detailed information about the Redpanda platform, see xref:get-started:intro-to-events.adoc[] and xref:get-started:architecture.adoc[].

== Redpanda Cloud cluster types

Redpanda offers four types of fully-managed cloud clusters. All products have access to unlimited storage and 280+ data connectors with xref:develop:connect/about.adoc[Redpanda Connect].

====

* The partition limit is the number of logical partitions before replication occurs. Redpanda Cloud uses a replication factor of 3.
* Enterprise support is staffed by streaming experts around the clock Monday through Friday, plus immediate escalation for production outages 24/7.
==== 

=== Serverless

Serverless is the fastest and easiest way to start data streaming. With Serverless clusters, you host your data in Redpanda's VPC, and Redpanda handles automatic scaling, provisioning, operations, and maintenance. This is a production-ready deployment option with a cluster available instantly, and with pay-as-you-go billing after the free trial, you only pay for what you consume. You can view detailed billing activity for each cluster and edit payment methods on the *Billing* page. 

NOTE: Serverless is currently in a limited availability (LA) release with xref:get-started:cluster-types/serverless.adoc#serverless-usage-limits[usage limits].

==== Sign up for Serverless

include::get-started:partial$get-started-serverless.adoc[] 

=== Dedicated Cloud

With Dedicated clusters, you host your data on Redpanda cloud resources (AWS, GCP, or Azure), and Redpanda handles provisioning, operations, and maintenance. Dedicated clusters are single-tenant deployments that support private networking (for example, VPC peering to talk over private IPs) for better data isolation.
When you create a Dedicated cluster, you select the supported xref:reference:tiers/dedicated-tiers.adoc[tier] that meets your compute and storage needs.

=== Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC)

With BYOC clusters, you deploy Redpanda in your own cloud (AWS, Azure, or GCP), and all data is
contained in your own environment. This provides an additional layer of security and isolation. (See <<BYOC architecture>>.) When you create a BYOC cluster, you select the supported xref:reference:tiers/byoc-tiers.adoc[tier] that meets your compute and storage needs. Redpanda handles provisioning, operations, and maintenance. 

NOTE: With standard BYOC clusters, Redpanda manages security policies and resources for your VPC or VNet, including subnetworks, IAM roles, and storage buckets/accounts. A Bring Your Own Virtual Private Cloud (BYOVPC) cluster allows you to deploy the Redpanda glossterm:data plane[] into your existing VPC/VNet and take full control of managing the networking lifecycle. Compared to standard BYOC, BYOVPC provides more security, but the configuration is more complex. See <<Shared responsibility model>>.

The BYOC infrastructure that Redpanda manages should not be used to deploy any other workloads.

==== Sign up for BYOC

To start using BYOC, contact https://redpanda.com/try-redpanda?section=enterprise-trial[Redpanda sales^] to request a private offer with possible discounts. You are billed directly or through Google Cloud Marketplace or AWS Marketplace. 

== Serverless vs Dedicated/BYOC

Serverless clusters are a good fit for the following use cases:

* Starter and growing workloads
* Spiky workloads (that is, development environments, systems that only occasionally get busy, or workloads that come and go)
* Fast and dynamic cluster creation: you can use a Serverless cluster as an isolated container for topics

With Serverless (and for Dedicated when procured through the AWS Marketplace), you only pay for what you consume, without any commitment. A cluster is created instantly, so you can surface it in your applications (for example, for tenant isolation). If your workload increases, you can migrate it to a Dedicated or BYOC cluster.

Consider Dedicated or BYOC if you need more control over the deployment or if you have workloads with consistently-high throughput. Dedicated and BYOC clusters offer the following features:

* Private networking
* Single-zone or multi-zone availability. A multi-zone cluster provides higher resiliency in the event of a failure in one of the zones. 
* Ability to export metrics to a 3rd-party monitoring system
* Kafka Connect
* Higher limits and quotas. See xref:reference:tiers/dedicated-tiers.adoc[Dedicated usage tiers] and xref:reference:tiers/byoc-tiers.adoc[BYOC usage tiers] compared to xref:get-started:cluster-types/serverless.adoc#serverless-usage-limits[Serverless limits].

== Shared responsibility model

The Redpanda Cloud shared responsibility model lists the security ownership areas for Redpanda and customers. Responsibilities depend on the type of deployment.

== Redpanda Connect and Kafka Connect

xref:develop:connect/about.adoc[Redpanda Connect] is integrated into Redpanda Cloud and available as a fully-managed service. Choose from a range of connectors, processors, and other components to quickly build and deploy streaming data pipelines or AI applications from the Cloud UI or using the pass:a,m[xref:{tag-pipeline-service}[Data Plane API\]]. Comprehensive metrics, monitoring, and per pipeline scaling are also available. To start using Redpanda Connect, xref:develop:connect/connect-quickstart.adoc[try this quickstart].

xref:develop:managed-connectors/index.adoc[Kafka Connect] is automatically enabled on AWS and GCP clusters. With this, there is a node running for Kafka Connect even if connectors are not used. To enable Kafka Connect on Azure clusters, see xref:get-started:cluster-types/byoc/azure/create-byoc-cluster-azure.adoc#enable-kafka-connect[Enable Kafka Connect].

== Redpanda Cloud architecture

When you sign up for a Redpanda account, Redpanda creates an organization for you. Your organization contains all your Redpanda resources, including your clusters and networks. Within your organization, Redpanda creates a default resource group to contain your resources. You can rename this resource group, and you can create more resource groups. For example, you may want different resource groups for production and testing. 

For high availability, Redpanda Cloud uses the following control plane - data plane architecture:

image::shared:control_d_plane.png[Control plane and data plane]

* *Control plane*: This is where most cluster management, operations, and maintenance takes place. The control plane enforces rules in the data plane. You can use role-based access control xref:security:authorization/rbac/rbac.adoc[(RBAC) in the control plane] to manage access to organization-level resources like clusters, resource groups, and networks. 

* *Data plane*: This is where your cluster lives. The term _data plane_ is sometimes used interchangeably with _cluster_. The data plane is where you manage topics, consumer groups, connectors, and schemas. You can use xref:security:authorization/rbac/rbac_dp.adoc[RBAC in the data plane] to configure cluster-level permissions for provisioned users at scale. 

* *Agent*: For BYOC, Redpanda uses an agent to manage the data plane from the control plane. The agent pulls cluster specifications from the control plane. IAM permissions allow the agent to access the the cloud provider API to create and manage cluster resources. The permissions follow the principle of least privilege, limiting access to only what is necessary.

Clusters are configured and maintained in the control plane, but they remain available even if the network connection to the control plane is lost. 

TIP: In the Redpanda Cloud UI, you see a different side navigation in the control plane and the data plane. You're in the control plane when you first log in. You're at the organization (org) level, and you haven't yet selected a cluster. This is where you can select, create, and delete clusters, networks, and resource groups. You're in the data plane when you're at the cluster level working with topics, consumer groups, connectors, and schemas.

=== BYOC architecture

In a BYOC architecture, you deploy the data plane in your own VPC. All network connections into the data plane take place through either a public endpoint, or for private clusters, through Redpanda Cloud network connections such as VPC peering, AWS PrivateLink, Azure Private Link, or GCP Private Service Connect. Customer data never leaves the data plane.

include::get-started:partial$no-access.adoc[]

A BYOC cluster is initially set up from the control plane. This is a two-step process performed by `rpk cloud byoc apply`:

. You bootstrap a virtual machine (VM) in your VPC. 
+
This VM spins up the agent and the required infrastructure. Redpanda assigns the necessary IAM policies required to run the agent and configures workload identity. That is, it configures independent IAM roles for each workload, with only the permissions each workload requires. 

. The agent communicates with the control plane to pull the cluster specifications. 
+
After the agent is up and running, it connects to the control plane and starts dequeuing and applying cluster specifications that provision, configure, and maintain clusters. The agent is in constant communication with the control plane,
receiving and applying cluster specifications and exchanging cluster metadata. Agents are authenticated and authorized through opaque and ephemeral tokens, and
they have dedicated job queues in the control plane. Agents also manage VPC peering networks. 
+
image::shared:byoc_apply.png[cloud_byoc_apply]

NOTE: To create a Redpanda cluster in your virtual private cloud (VPC), follow the instructions in the Redpanda Cloud UI. The UI contains the parameters necessary to successfully run `rpk cloud byoc apply` with your cloud provider. 

== Redpanda Cloud vs Self-Managed feature compatibility

Because Redpanda Cloud is a fully-managed service that provides maintenance, data and partition balancing, upgrades, and recovery, much of the cluster maintenance required for Self-Managed users is not necessary for Redpanda Cloud users. Also, Redpanda Cloud is opinionated about Kafka configurations. For example, automatic topic creation is disabled. Some systems expect the Kafka service to automatically create topics when a message is produced to a topic that doesn't exist. (You can create topics in Redpanda Cloud on the *Topics* page or with `rpk topic create`.)

New clusters in Redpanda Cloud generally include functionality added in Self-Managed versions immediately. Existing clusters include new functionality when they get upgraded to the latest version. 

Redpanda Cloud deployments do not support the following functionality available in Redpanda Self-Managed deployments:

- Integration with Apache Iceberg. For private beta access on BYOC, contact https://support.redpanda.com/hc/en-us/requests/new[Redpanda Support^].
- Data transforms. For private beta access, contact https://support.redpanda.com/hc/en-us/requests/new[Redpanda Support^].
- Remote Read Replicas. This is in beta for Redpanda Cloud.
- Kafka API OIDC authentication. However, Redpanda Cloud does support xref:security:cloud-authentication.adoc#single-sign-on[SSO to the Redpanda Cloud UI].
- Admin API.
- FIPS-compliance mode.
- Kerberos authentication.
- Redpanda debug bundles.
- Redpanda Console topic documentation.
- Configuring access to object storage with customer-managed encryption key.
- Kubernetes Helm chart and Redpanda Operator functionality.
- The following `rpk` commands:
 
** `rpk cluster config`
** `rpk cluster health`
** `rpk cluster license`
** `rpk cluster maintenance`
** `rpk cluster partitions`
** `rpk cluster self-test`
** `rpk cluster storage`
** `rpk connect` 
** `rpk container` 
** `rpk debug` 
** `rpk iotune`
** `rpk redpanda`
** `rpk topic describe-storage` (All other `rpk topic` commands are supported on both Redpanda Cloud and Self Managed.)
** `rpk transform` (This is in beta for Redpanda Cloud.)
** `rpk generate app` (This is supported in Serverless clusters only.)
+
NOTE: The `rpk cloud` commands are not supported in Self-Managed deployments.
