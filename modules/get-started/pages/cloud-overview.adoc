Redpanda Cloud is a complete data streaming platform delivered as a fully-managed service. It provides automated upgrades and patching, data balancing, and support while continuously monitoring your clusters and underlying infrastructure to meet strict performance, availability, reliability, and security requirements. All Redpanda Cloud clusters are deployed with an integrated glossterm:Redpanda Console[], and all clusters have access to unlimited retention and 300+ data connectors with xref:develop:connect/about.adoc[Redpanda Connect].

TIP: For more detailed information about the Redpanda platform, see xref:get-started:intro-to-events.adoc[] and xref:get-started:architecture.adoc[].

== Redpanda Agent Development Platform (ADP)

Redpanda Cloud delivers the Agent Development Platform (ADP), an enterprise-grade infrastructure for building, deploying, and managing AI agents at scale. ADP provides unified governance, observability, and security for agentic applications while leveraging Redpanda's streaming and analytical capabilities as the foundational data fabric.

=== What is ADP?

ADP combines multiple components into a cohesive platform:

* **AI Agents**: Deploy declarative agents or bring your own agent frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex, and others)
* **MCP Servers**: Expose data and actions to agents through the Model Context Protocol, built on xref:develop:connect/about.adoc[Redpanda Connect]
* **AI Gateway**: Manage LLM provider access with cost controls, rate limiting, and intelligent routing
* **Catalog**: Centralized view of all agents, tools, and access policies across your organization

=== Enterprise capabilities

ADP addresses critical enterprise requirements for AI agent deployments:

**Unified authorization**:: All components use OIDC-based authentication with an "on-behalf-of" authorization model. When a user invokes an agent, the agent inherits the intersection of its own permissions and the user's permissions, ensuring proper data access scoping.

**Complete observability**:: ADP captures execution logs (agent transcripts) using OpenTelemetry standards with 100% trace sampling. View agent actions in Redpanda Console, query execution history with OXLA, and replay data for agent evaluations.

**Compliance and audit**:: For industries requiring multi-year audit trails, ADP records every agent action and data source used in decision-making. Execution logs are stored in Redpanda topics and can be materialized to Iceberg tables for long-term retention and analysis.

=== ADP deployment model

ADP is primarily deployed using the <<Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC)>> model, where:

* The **control plane** (managed by Redpanda) handles provisioning, monitoring, and policy management
* The **data plane** (deployed in your cloud account) runs the ADP components, Redpanda cluster, and OXLA query engine
* All your data remains in your infrastructure, providing maximum security and data sovereignty

ADP installations include both Redpanda (for streaming and event storage) and OXLA (for SQL-based queries and analytics), forming the data fabric that powers agent applications.

=== Use cases

Organizations use ADP to:

* **Extend Microsoft Copilot**: Integrate Office 365 agents with internal data sources that Copilot cannot access
* **Build domain-specific agents**: Create specialized agents for operational tasks, like querying building management systems or financial compliance workflows
* **Enable non-technical users**: Allow business users to interact with complex data through natural language interfaces instead of dashboards or SQL

For details about building agents and MCP servers, see xref:ai-agents:index.adoc[].

== Redpanda Cloud cluster types

ADP and Redpanda Cloud applications are supported by three fully-managed deployment options. For ADP deployments, <<Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC)>> is the primary model, providing the security and data sovereignty required for enterprise agent platforms. For streaming applications, all three options are available:

* **<<Serverless>>**: Fastest way to get started with automatic scaling
* **<<Dedicated>>**: Production clusters in Redpanda's cloud with enhanced isolation
* **<<Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC)>>**: Maximum control and security by deploying in your own cloud environment

=== Serverless

Serverless is the fastest and easiest way to start data streaming. With Serverless clusters, you host your data in Redpanda's VPC, and Redpanda handles automatic scaling, provisioning, operations, and maintenance. This is a production-ready deployment option with a cluster available instantly, and you only pay for what you consume. 

[NOTE]
====
* Serverless on GCP is currently in a glossterm:beta[] release.

==== Sign up for Serverless

include::get-started:partial$get-started-serverless.adoc[] 

=== Dedicated

With Dedicated clusters, you host your data on Redpanda Cloud resources (AWS, GCP, or Azure), and Redpanda handles provisioning, operations, and maintenance. Dedicated clusters are single-tenant deployments that support private networking (for example, VPC peering to talk over private IPs) for better data isolation.
When you create a Dedicated cluster, you select the supported xref:reference:tiers/dedicated-tiers.adoc[tier] that meets your compute and storage needs.

=== Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC)

BYOC is the primary deployment model for the Agent Development Platform (ADP). With BYOC clusters, the Redpanda data plane (including ADP components, Redpanda brokers, and OXLA) deploys into your existing VPC or VNet, ensuring all data remains in your environment.

With BYOC clusters, you deploy the Redpanda glossterm:data plane[] into your existing VPC (for AWS and GCP) or VNet (for Azure), and all data is
contained in your own environment. This provides an additional layer of security and isolation. (See xref:get-started:byoc-arch.adoc[].) Redpanda manages provisioning, monitoring, upgrades, and security policies, and it manages required resources in your VPC or VNet, including subnets (subnetworks in GCP), IAM roles, and object storage resources (for example, S3 buckets or Azure Storage accounts). 

==== Bring Your Own VPC/VNet (BYOVPC/BYOVNet) 

With BYOVPC/BYOVNet clusters, you take full control of the networking lifecycle. Compared to standard BYOC, BYOVPC/BYOVNet provides more security, but the configuration is more complex. See the xref:get-started:cloud-overview.adoc#shared-responsibility-model[shared responsibility model] to understand what you manage versus what Redpanda manages.

The BYOC infrastructure that Redpanda manages should not be used to deploy any other workloads.

==== Sign up for BYOC

To start using BYOC, contact https://redpanda.com/try-redpanda?section=enterprise-trial[Redpanda sales^] to request a private offer with possible discounts. You are billed directly or through Google Cloud Marketplace or AWS Marketplace. 

=== Serverless vs BYOC/Dedicated

Serverless clusters are a good fit for the following use cases:

* Quick setup for development or testing
* Variable or unpredictable traffic patterns
* No upfront cost commitment
* Isolated environments for different applications

Consider BYOC or Dedicated if you need more control over the deployment or if you have workloads with consistently-high throughput. BYOC and Dedicated clusters offer the following features:

* Multiple availability zones (AZs). A multi-AZ cluster provides higher resiliency in the event of a failure in one of the zones. 
* Role-based access control (RBAC) in the data plane
* Kafka Connect
* Higher limits and quotas. See xref:reference:tiers/byoc-tiers.adoc[BYOC usage tiers] and xref:reference:tiers/dedicated-tiers.adoc[Dedicated usage tiers] compared to xref:get-started:cluster-types/serverless.adoc#serverless-usage-limits[Serverless limits].

== Redpanda Cloud architecture

When you sign up for a Redpanda account, Redpanda creates an organization for you. Your organization contains all your Redpanda resources, including your clusters and networks. Within your organization, Redpanda creates a default resource group to contain your resources. You can rename this resource group, and you can create more resource groups. For example, you may want different resource groups for production and testing.

For details about the control plane - data plane framework in BYOC, see xref:get-started:byoc-arch.adoc[BYOC architecture].

== Shared responsibility model

The Redpanda Cloud shared responsibility model lists the security areas owned by Redpanda and the security areas owned by customers. Responsibilities depend on the type of deployment.

== Redpanda Connect and Kafka Connect

xref:develop:connect/about.adoc[Redpanda Connect] lets you compose pipelines from a rich library of inputs, processors, and outputs with strong metrics, logging, and per-pipeline scaling. To try it, see the xref:develop:connect/connect-quickstart.adoc[quickstart].

xref:develop:managed-connectors/index.adoc[Kafka Connect] is disabled by default on all new clusters. To unlock this feature for your BYOC or Dedicated cluster, contact https://support.redpanda.com/hc/en-us/requests/new[Redpanda Support^]. When enabled, a Kafka Connect node runs even if no connectors are configured.

=== Redpanda Connect vs data transforms

xref:develop:data-transforms/how-transforms-work.adoc[Data transforms] (Wasm) provide lightweight, per-record changes between Redpanda topics with minimal latency. Transforms run inside the broker, map one input topic to one or more output topics, and are intentionally sandboxed (no external network or disk access). They're ideal for validation, redaction, format/schema conversion, and simple routing.

[cols="1,2,2",options="header",stripes=none]
|===
|  | Data transforms | Redpanda Connect

| Best for
| Simple, stateless, per-record normalization inside Redpanda
| Enrichment/lookup with external services; multi-stage flows

| External I/O
| Not permitted (sandboxed)
| Native (HTTP/database/object storage)

| Topology
| 1:1 or 1:N (no cross-topic fan-in)
| Fan-in and fan-out; multi-step pipelines

| Ordering
| Preserves per-partition order
| Per-partition order can be preserved; configure parallelism and batching accordingly

| Scale & isolation
| Shares broker CPU/memory; best for lightweight operations
| Scales independently; isolates heavy work from brokers

| Failure handling
| You code routing/error behavior
| Built-in retries/backoff and DLQ patterns
|===

[TIP]
====
* Use data transforms for simple, in-broker, per-record changes with minimal latency.
* Use Redpanda Connect if your pipeline must talk to external systems (HTTP services, databases, cloud storage), or when you need advanced flow control, such as batching and windowed processing. 
====

== Redpanda Cloud vs Self-Managed feature compatibility

Because Redpanda Cloud is a fully-managed service that provides maintenance, data and partition balancing, upgrades, and recovery, much of the cluster maintenance required for Self-Managed users is not necessary for Redpanda Cloud users. Also, Redpanda Cloud is opinionated about Kafka configurations. For example, automatic topic creation is disabled. Some systems expect the Kafka service to automatically create topics when a message is produced to a topic that doesn't exist. (You can enable this for BYOC and Dedicated clusters with the `auto_create_topics_enabled` cluster property.)

New clusters in Redpanda Cloud generally include functionality added in Self-Managed versions immediately. Existing clusters include new functionality when they get upgraded to the latest version. 

Redpanda Cloud deployments do not support the following functionality available in Redpanda Self-Managed deployments:

- Kafka API OIDC authentication. However, Redpanda Cloud does support xref:security:cloud-authentication.adoc#single-sign-on[SSO to the Redpanda Cloud UI].
- Admin API.
- FIPS-compliance mode.
- Kerberos authentication.
- Redpanda debug bundles.
- Redpanda Console topic documentation.
- Manual deserialization of Schema Registry
- Configuring access to object storage with customer-managed encryption key.
- Kubernetes Helm chart and Redpanda Operator functionality.
- The following `rpk` commands:
 
** `rpk cluster health`
** `rpk cluster license`
** `rpk cluster maintenance`
** `rpk cluster partitions`
** `rpk cluster self-test`
** `rpk cluster storage restore` (But `rpk cluster storage` and subcommands for mountable topics are supported in BYOC and Dedicated clusters)
** `rpk connect` 
** `rpk container` 
** `rpk debug` 
** `rpk generate app` (This is supported in Serverless clusters only.)
** `rpk iotune`
** `rpk redpanda`
** `rpk topic describe-storage` (All other `rpk topic` commands are supported on both Redpanda Cloud and Self Managed.)
+
NOTE: The `rpk cloud` commands are not supported in Self-Managed deployments.
