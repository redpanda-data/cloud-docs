TIP: The cluster's *Overview* page includes a *Get Started* wizard to quickly pipeline your data into and out of Redpanda. The wizard guides you to select an input data source (to produce data into Redpanda) or output data sink (to consume data from Redpanda into an external system), select a topic to store the data in Redpanda, and select a user who will interact with the topic. Advanced users can skip directly to the *Edit pipeline* step to configure the YAML file themselves. See also: xref:develop:connect/connect-quickstart.adoc[Redpanda Connect quickstart].
