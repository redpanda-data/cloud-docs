TIP: The cluster's *Overview* page includes a *Get Started* wizard to quickly pipeline your data into and out of Redpanda. The wizard helps you select an input data source (to stream data into Redpanda) or output data sink (to stream data in Redpanda to an external system), and configure minimal settings. Advanced users can skip directly to the *Edit pipeline* step to configure the YAML file. See also: xref:develop:connect/connect-quickstart.adoc[Redpanda Connect quickstart].
