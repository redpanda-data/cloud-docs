A cluster's *Overview* page provides a *Get Started* wizard to quickly create a xref:develop:connect/about.adoc[Redpanda Connect] pipeline. Pipelines help you stream data into and out of Redpanda without writing producer/consumer code. The get started wizard helps you select an input data source (to stream data into Redpanda) or output data sink (to stream data in Redpanda to an external system), and configure minimal settings. Open the Redpanda glossterm:topic[] to see messages streaming and verify the data flow. You can create pipelines anytime from the *Overview* page or on the *Connect* page.
