= Redpanda Connect Quickstart
:description: Learn how to quickly start building data pipelines with Redpanda Connect. 

The *Connect* page provides a wizard that creates pipelines to stream data into and out of Redpanda. The wizard populates the YAML configuration automatically, so you can get started quickly.

TIP: Advanced users can skip directly to the *Edit pipeline* step in the wizard to configure the YAML file themselves. 

This quickstart shows how Redpanda Connect can generate, transform, and handle streaming data end-to-end. It creates the following pipelines: 

* The first pipeline generates (produces) dad jokes every five seconds and writes them to a topic in your cluster. 
* The second pipeline reads (consumes) those dad jokes and gives each one a random "cringe rating" from 1-10. The cringier the dad joke, the higher the rating.

The *producer pipeline* uses the following Redpanda Connect components:

[cols="1,2,3"]
|===
|Component type |Component |Purpose

|Input
|xref:develop:connect/components/inputs/generate.adoc[`generate`]
|Creates jokes

|Output
|xref:components:outputs/redpanda.adoc[`redpanda`]
|Writes messages to your cluster topic

|Processor
|xref:components:processors/log.adoc[`log`]
|Logs generated messages

|Processor
|xref:components:processors/catch.adoc[`catch`]
|Catches errors 
|===


The *consumer pipeline* uses the following Redpanda Connect components:

[cols="1,2,3"]
|===
|Component type |Component |Purpose

|Input
|xref:components:inputs/redpanda.adoc[`redpanda`]
|Reads messages from your cluster topic 

|Output
|xref:components:outputs/drop.adoc[`drop`]
|Drops the processed messages

|Processor
|xref:components:processors/bloblang.adoc[`bloblang`]
|Processes messages

|Processor
|xref:components:processors/log.adoc[`log`]
|Logs processed messages

|Processor
|xref:components:processors/catch.adoc[`catch`]
|Catches errors

== Prerequisites

You must have a Redpanda Cloud account with a Serverless, Dedicated, or standard BYOC cluster. If you don't already have an account, https://redpanda.com/try-redpanda/cloud-trial[sign up for a free trial^].

NOTE: Serverless supports up to 10 pipelines.

== Build a producer pipeline

Follow these steps to create your producer pipeline:

. Go to the **Connect** page on your cluster, and click **Create pipeline**.

. **Add an input**: Search for and select `generate` from the list of connectors. Click **Next**.

. **Add an output**: Search for and select `redpanda` from the list of connectors. Click **Next**.

. **Add a topic**: Select to create a new topic called `dad-jokes`. This is where Redpanda will store the generated messages. Click **Next**.

. **Add permissions**: 
.. Select to configure a new user called `connect`. 
.. Select to enable topic-specific permissions for this user. This is required, because the user must have read and write permissions to interact with the topic.
.. Click **Next**.

. **Edit pipeline**:
.. Enter this name for the pipeline: `joke-generator`.
.. The **Configuration** section automatically populates the YAML with your selected components. 
+
Here you could add the `log` and `catch` processors to monitor for errors and log generated jokes.
+
Copy and paste the following YAML, which includes the processors and the input `mapping` for the joke generation:
+
[source,yaml]
----
input:
  generate:
    interval: 5s
    count: 0
    mapping: |
      let jokes = [
        "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!",
        "I'm reading a book about anti-gravity. It's impossible to put down!",
        "Why did the scarecrow win an award? He was outstanding in his field!",
        "What do you call a fake noodle? An impasta!",
        "Why don't eggs tell jokes? They'd crack each other up!",
        "I used to play piano by ear, but now I use my hands.",
        "What do you call a bear with no teeth? A gummy bear!",
        "Why did the bicycle fall over? It was two tired!",
        "What do you call a fish wearing a crown? A king fish!",
        "Why don't skeletons fight each other? They don't have the guts!",
        "What do you call cheese that isn't yours? Nacho cheese!",
        "Why can't you hear a pterodactyl using the bathroom? Because the 'p' is silent!",
        "What did the ocean say to the beach? Nothing, it just waved!",
        "Why did the math book look sad? It had too many problems!",
        "What do you call a sleeping bull? A bulldozer!",
        "How do you organize a space party? You planet!",
        "What's orange and sounds like a parrot? A carrot!",
        "Why did the coffee file a police report? It got mugged!",
        "What do you call a can opener that doesn't work? A can't opener!",
        "Why don't oysters donate to charity? Because they're shellfish!"
      ]
      
      let joke_index = random_int() % $jokes.length()
      
      root.joke = $jokes.index($joke_index)
      root.id = uuid_v4()
      root.timestamp = now()
      root.source = "dad-joke-generator"
      root.joke_length = root.joke.length()


pipeline:
  processors:
    - log:
        level: INFO
        message: "📝 Generating joke: ${! json(\"joke\") }"
    
    - catch:
        - log:
            level: ERROR
            message: "❌ Error generating joke: ${! error() }"


output:
  redpanda:
    seed_brokers:
      - ${REDPANDA_BROKERS}
    topic: dad-jokes
    key: ${! json("id") }
    tls:
      enabled: true
    sasl:
      - mechanism: SCRAM-SHA-256
        username: 
        password:

.. Click **Create** to start your pipeline.


. Your pipeline details are displayed, and after a few seconds, the status changes from **Starting** to **Running**. If you don't see this change, refresh the page.
+
Once running, your pipeline will generate new names every second and write the processed messages to your topic.

+
After a minute, select the pipeline, and click **Stop** so you can examine the results.

[NOTE]
====
* Notice the `$\{REDPANDA_BROKERS}` xref:develop:connect/configuration/contextual-variables.adoc[contextual variable] in the configuration. This automatically references your cluster's bootstrap server address, so you can use it in any pipeline without hardcoding connection details. 
* The Brave browser does not fully support code snippets.

=== View the processed messages

. Go to the **Topics** page and select the `dad-jokes` topic.
. Click any message to see the structure.
+
<NEED TO REPLACE WHEN I CAN SEE MESSAGES>
+
[source,json]
----
{
    "content": "Aliquam quidem tempore expedita debitis ab. Officiis optio eveniet ab magni commodi...",
    "id": "35522c66-6fcd-47da-b97b-857b983477d1",
    "title": "PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL",
    "user": {
        "email": "oCcXPTh@RrKHZRQ.info",
        "name": "King Francis Torphy"
    }
}
----

=== Review the pipeline logs

. Return to the **Connect** page and select your `joke-generator` pipeline.
. Click the **Logs** tab to see the pipeline's activity log. 
. Click through the log messages to see the startup sequence. For example, you'll see when the output becomes active:

+
[source,json]
----
{
    "instance_id": "d44h0bu39lps738ka4s0",
    "label": "",
    "level": "INFO",
    "message": "Input type generate is now active",
    "path": "root.input",
    "pipeline_id": "d44h0avvvrpc73bjgfgg",
    "time": "2025-11-03T20:27:28.166597505Z"
}
----

+
And when the processor generates a joke:
+
[source,json]
----
{
    "custom_source": "true",
    "instance_id": "d44h0bu39lps738ka4s0",
    "label": "",
    "level": "INFO",
    "message": "📝 Generating joke: What did the ocean say to the beach? Nothing, it just waved!",
    "path": "root.pipeline.processors.0",
    "pipeline_id": "d44h0avvvrpc73bjgfgg",
    "time": "2025-11-03T20:27:32.875101811Z"
}
----

=== Build a consumer pipeline

This pipeline reads from the same topic created in the first pipeline. Follow these steps to create your consumer pipeline:

. Go to the **Connect** page on your cluster, and click **Create pipeline**.

. **Add an input**: Search for and select `redpanda` from the list of connectors. Click **Next**.

. **Add an output**: Search for and select `drop` from the list of connectors. (Because this quickstart is just for testing, this output drops the message instead of sending it anywhere else.) Click **Next**.

. **Add a topic**: Select the existing topic called `dad-jokes`. This is where Redpanda stored the generated jokes in your producer pipeline. Click **Next**.

. **Add permissions**: 
.. Select to configure the existing user called `connect`.
.. Select to enable topic-specific permissions for this user. This is required, because the user must have read and write permissions to interact with the topic.
.. Add a consumer group: Enter `dad-joke-raters` as the name for the consumer group.
.. Click **Next**.

. **Edit pipeline**:
.. Enter this name for the pipeline: `joke-generator-consumer`.
.. The **Configuration** section automatically populates the YAML with your selected components. To enhance the pipeline, replace the entire configuration with the following YAML, which adds the `bloblang` processor. Bloblang is Redpanda Connect's scripting language used to add logic (for example, random ratings).

+

        root.cringe_rating = $rating
        
        root.cringe_level = if $rating <= 3 {
          "Mild - Almost acceptable"
        } else if $rating <= 6 {
          "Medium - Classic dad joke territory"
        } else if $rating <= 8 {
          "High - Eye-roll inducing"
        } else {
          "EXTREME - Peak dad joke achievement"
        }
        
        root.processed_at = now()
        
        root.rating_emoji = match {
          $rating <= 3 => "😐",
          $rating <= 6 => "😬",
          $rating <= 8 => "🤦",
          _ => "💀"
        }
        
        let age_seconds = (timestamp_unix() - this.timestamp.ts_parse("2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00").ts_unix())
        root.age_seconds = $age_seconds
    
    - log:
        level: INFO
        message: |
          🎭 JOKE RATED! ${! json("rating_emoji") }
          Joke: "${! json("joke") }"

    - catch:
        - log:
            level: ERROR
            message: "❌ Failed to process joke: ${! error() }"


output:
  drop: {}
