= Redpanda Connect Quickstart
:description: Learn how to quickly start building data pipelines with Redpanda Connect. 

The *Connect* page provides a wizard to create pipelines for streaming data into and out of Redpanda. The wizard populates the YAML configuration automatically, so you can get started quickly.

TIP: Advanced users can skip directly to the *Edit pipeline* step in the wizard to configure the YAML file themselves. 

This quickstart shows how Redpanda Connect can generate, transform, and handle streaming data end-to-end. It creates the following pipelines: 

* The first pipeline generates (produces) dad jokes and writes them to a topic in your cluster. 
* The second pipeline reads (consumes) those dad jokes and gives each one a random "cringe rating" from 1-10. 

The *producer pipeline* uses the following Redpanda Connect components:

[cols="1,2,3"]
|===
|Component type |Component |Purpose

|Input
|xref:develop:connect/components/inputs/generate.adoc[`generate`]
|Creates jokes

|Output
|xref:components:outputs/redpanda.adoc[`redpanda`]
|Writes messages to your cluster topic

|Processor
|xref:components:processors/log.adoc[`log`]
|Logs generated messages

|Processor
|xref:components:processors/catch.adoc[`catch`]
|Catches errors 
|===


The *consumer pipeline* uses the following Redpanda Connect components:

[cols="1,2,3"]
|===
|Component type |Component |Purpose

|Input
|xref:components:inputs/redpanda.adoc[`redpanda`]
|Reads messages from your cluster topic 

|Output
|xref:components:outputs/drop.adoc[`drop`]
|Drops the processed messages

|Processor
|xref:components:processors/bloblang.adoc[`bloblang`]
|Processes ratings

|Processor

|Logs processed messages

|Processor
|xref:components:processors/catch.adoc[`catch`]
|Catches errors

== Prerequisites

You must have a Redpanda Cloud account with a Serverless, Dedicated, or standard BYOC cluster. If you don't already have an account, https://redpanda.com/try-redpanda/cloud-trial[sign up for a free trial^].

NOTE: Serverless clusters support up to 10 pipelines.

== Build a producer pipeline

Follow these steps to create the producer pipeline:

. Go to the **Connect** page for your cluster to create a pipeline.

. **Add an input**: Search for and select `generate` from the list of connectors. Click **Next**.

. **Add an output**: Search for and select `redpanda` from the list of connectors. Click **Next**.

. **Add a topic**: Create a new topic called `dad-jokes`. This is where Redpanda will store the generated messages. Click **Next**.

. **Add permissions**: 
.. Create a new user called `connect`. 
.. Leave the rest of the default settings. 
.. Click **Next**.

. **Edit pipeline**:
.. Enter this name for the pipeline: `joke-generator-producer`.
.. The **Configuration** section automatically populates the YAML with your selected components. Under *Connectors*, you can add the processors `log` and `catch` to log generated jokes and monitor for errors. However, for this simplicity in this quickstart, replace the entire configuration with the following YAML, which includes the processors and the `mapping` for joke generation:
+
[source,yaml]
----
input:
  generate:
    interval: 5s
    count: 0
    mapping: |
      let jokes = [
        "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!",
        "I'm reading a book about anti-gravity. It's impossible to put down!",
        "Why did the scarecrow win an award? He was outstanding in his field!",
        "What do you call a fake noodle? An impasta!",
        "Why don't eggs tell jokes? They'd crack each other up!",
        "I used to play piano by ear, but now I use my hands.",
        "What do you call a bear with no teeth? A gummy bear!",
        "Why did the bicycle fall over? It was two tired!",
        "What do you call a fish wearing a crown? A king fish!",
        "Why don't skeletons fight each other? They don't have the guts!",
        "What do you call cheese that isn't yours? Nacho cheese!",
        "Why can't you hear a pterodactyl using the bathroom? Because the 'p' is silent!",
        "What did the ocean say to the beach? Nothing, it just waved!",
        "Why did the math book look sad? It had too many problems!",
        "What do you call a sleeping bull? A bulldozer!",
        "How do you organize a space party? You planet!",
        "What's orange and sounds like a parrot? A carrot!",
        "Why did the coffee file a police report? It got mugged!",
        "What do you call a can opener that doesn't work? A can't opener!",
        "Why don't oysters donate to charity? Because they're shellfish!"
      ]

      let joke_index = random_int() % $jokes.length()

      root.joke = $jokes.index($joke_index)
      root.id = uuid_v4()
      root.timestamp = now()
      root.source = "dad-joke-generator"
      root.joke_length = root.joke.length()


pipeline:
  processors:
    - log:
        level: INFO
        message: "📝 Generating joke: ${! json(\"joke\") }"

    - catch:
        - log:
            level: ERROR
            message: "❌ Error generating joke: ${! error() }"

output:
  redpanda:
    seed_brokers: # Optional
      - ${REDPANDA_BROKERS}
    tls:
      enabled: true # Optional (default: false)
      client_certs: []
    sasl:
      - mechanism: SCRAM-SHA-256
        username: ${secrets.KAFKA_USER_CONNECT}
        password: ${secrets.KAFKA_PASSWORD_CONNECT}
    topic: dad-jokes # Optional


----

.. Click **Create** to start your pipeline.


. Your pipeline details are displayed, and after a few seconds, the status changes from **Starting** to **Running**. If you don't see this change, refresh the page. Once running, your pipeline will generate new jokes every five seconds and write each joke to your topic.

+
After a minute, select the pipeline and click **Stop** so you can examine the results. You should see the active input and output types in the logs, and in your topic, you can view the generated jokes.

[NOTE]
====
* Notice the `$\{REDPANDA_BROKERS}` xref:develop:connect/configuration/contextual-variables.adoc[contextual variable] in the configuration. This automatically references your cluster's bootstrap server address, so you can use it in any pipeline without hardcoding connection details. 
* The Brave browser does not fully support code snippets.

=== Review the pipeline logs

. Click the **Logs** tab to see the pipeline's activity log. 
. Click through the log messages to see the startup sequence. For example, you'll see when the output becomes active:

+
[source,json]
----
{
    "instance_id": "d4548gl54smc73b65t0g",
    "label": "",
    "level": "INFO",
    "message": "Output type redpanda is now active",
    "path": "root.output",
    "pipeline_id": "d4548fihlips73dmcl80",
    "time": "2025-11-04T18:21:55.223350785Z"
}
----


=== View the processed messages

. Go to the **Topics** page and select the `dad-jokes` topic.
. Click any message to see the structure. For example:
+
[source,json]
----
{
    "id": "cf653b9e-ce96-4790-888f-6a867bed56a5",
    "joke": "I used to play piano by ear, but now I use my hands.",
    "joke_length": 52,
    "source": "dad-joke-generator",
    "timestamp": "2025-11-04T18:21:55.020574506Z"
}
----


== Build a consumer pipeline

This pipeline reads the jokes generated in the `dad-jokes` topic that you created in the first pipeline. Follow these steps to create the consumer pipeline:

. On the **Connect** page for your cluster, click **Create pipeline**.

. **Add an input**: Search for and select `redpanda` from the list of connectors. Click **Next**.

. **Add an output**: Search for and select `drop` from the list of connectors. (Because this quickstart is just for testing, this output drops the message instead of sending it anywhere else.) Click **Next**.

. **Add a topic**: Select the existing topic called `dad-jokes`. Click **Next**.

. **Add permissions**: 
.. Select the existing user called `connect`.
.. Add a consumer group: Enter `dad-joke-raters` as the name for the consumer group. It will be generated with the necessary permissions.
.. Click **Next**.

. **Edit pipeline**:
.. Enter this name for the pipeline: `joke-generator-consumer`.
.. The **Configuration** section automatically populates the YAML with your selected components. To add the `bloblang`, `log`, and `catch` processors, replace the entire configuration with the following YAML. Bloblang is Redpanda Connect's scripting language used to add logic (for example, random ratings).

.. Click **Create** to start your pipeline.


. Your pipeline details are displayed, and after a few seconds, the status changes from **Starting** to **Running**. If you don't see this change, refresh the page.

+
After a minute, select the pipeline and click **Stop** so you can examine the logs and see the processed messages, similar to the first pipeline.

== Clean up

When you've finished experimenting with your data pipeline, you can delete the pipelines and the topic you created for this quickstart.

. On the **Connect** page, select the delete icon next to the `joke-generator-producer` pipeline and the `joke-generator-consumer` pipeline.
. Confirm your deletion to remove the pipelines and associated logs.
. On the **Topics** page, delete the `dad-jokes` topic.
