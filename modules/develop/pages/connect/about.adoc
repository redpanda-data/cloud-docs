* Integrate data sources (inputs)
* Write to data sinks (outputs)
* Transform data (processors)

Comprehensive data pipeline metrics are also available to help you to monitor the behavior, health, and performance of your data pipelines.

TIP: If youâ€™re new to Redpanda Connect, try building and testing data pipelines locally before deploying to the Cloud.
