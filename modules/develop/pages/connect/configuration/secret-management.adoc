= Manage Secrets
:description: Learn how to manage secrets in Redpanda Connect using the Cloud UI or Data Plane API, and how to add them to your data pipelines.

Learn how to manage secrets in Redpanda Connect, and how to add them to your data pipelines without exposing them.

Secrets are stored in the secret management solution of your Cloud provider and are retrieved when you run a pipeline configuration that references them. For more information about the way secrets are stored in Redpanda Cloud, see xref:security:secrets.adoc[Secrets].

== Prerequisites

* A running BYOC, Dedicated or Serverless cluster
* Secrets management enabled

== Manage secrets

You can manage secrets from the Cloud UI or Data Plane API.

=== Create a secret

You can create a secret and reference it in multiple data pipelines on the same cluster.

=====
Cloud UI (BYOC and Dedicated)::
+
--
. Log in to https://cloud.redpanda.com[Redpanda Cloud^].
. Go to the **Connect** page.
. Select the **Redpanda Connect** tab and then the **Secrets** tab.
. Click **Create secret**.
. In **Secret name**, enter a name for the secret. You cannot rename the secret once it is created.
. In **Secret value**, enter the secret you need to add.
. Click **Create secret**.
+
The secret details are listed in the **Secrets** tab ready to <<add-a-secret-to-a-data-pipeline,add to your data pipelines>>.

--

Cloud UI (Serverless)::
+
--
. Log in to https://cloud.redpanda.com[Redpanda Cloud^].
. Go to the **Connect** page.
. Select the **Secrets** tab and click **Create secret**.
. In **Secret name**, enter a name for the secret. You cannot rename the secret once it is created.
. In **Secret value**, enter the secret you need to add.
. Click **Create secret**.
+
The secret details are listed in the **Secrets** tab ready to <<add-a-secret-to-a-data-pipeline,add to your data pipelines>>.

Data Plane API::
+
--
You must use a Base64-encoded secret.

. xref:manage:api/cloud-api-quickstart.adoc#try-the-cloud-api[Authenticate and get the base URL] for the Data Plane API.
. Make a request to xref:api:ROOT:cloud-api.adoc#post-/v1alpha2/secrets[`POST /v1alpha2/secrets`].
+
[,bash]
----
curl -X POST "https://<dataplane-api-url>/v1alpha2/secrets" \
 -H 'accept: application/json'\
 -H 'authorization: Bearer <token>'\
 -H 'content-type: application/json' \
 -d '{"id":"<secret-name>","scopes":["SCOPE_REDPANDA_CONNECT"],"secret_data":"<secret-value>"}' 
----
+
You must include the following values:

- `<dataplane-api-url>`: The base URL for the Data Plane API.
- `<token>`: The API key you generated during authentication.
- `<secret-name>`: The ID or name of the secret you want to add. Use only the following characters: `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*$`.
- `<secret-value>`: The Base64-encoded secret.
- This scope: `"SCOPE_REDPANDA_CONNECT"`.

+
The response returns the name of the secret and the scope `"SCOPE_REDPANDA_CONNECT"`.

You can now <<add-a-secret-to-a-data-pipeline,add the secret to your data pipeline>>.

=== Update a secret

You can only update the secret value, not its name.

NOTE: Changes to secret values do not take effect until a pipeline is restarted.

=== Delete a secret

Before you delete a secret, make sure that you remove references to it from your data pipelines. 

NOTE: Changes do not affect pipelines that are already running. Secrets are not removed until a pipeline is restarted.

== Add a secret to a data pipeline

You can add a secret to any pipeline in your cluster using the notation `${secrets.SECRET_NAME}`. In the Cloud UI, you can copy the notation from the **Secrets** tab.

For example:

```yml
    sasl:
      - mechanism: SCRAM-SHA-256
        username: "user"
        password: "${secrets.PASSWORD}"
```
