= Monitor Data Pipelines on BYOC Clusters
:description: Configure Prometheus monitoring of your data pipelines on BYOC clusters.

You can configure monitoring on BYOC clusters to understand the behavior, health, and performance of your data pipelines. 

Redpanda Connect automatically exports xref:components:metrics/about.adoc[detailed metrics for each component of your data pipeline] to a Prometheus endpoint, along with metrics for all other cluster services. You donâ€™t need to update the configuration of your pipeline.

== Configure Prometheus

To monitor a BYOC cluster in https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus^]:

. On the Redpanda Cloud *Overview* page for your cluster, under *How to connect*, click the *Prometheus* tab. 

. Click the copy icon next to *Prometheus YAML* to copy the contents to your clipboard. 
+
The YAML contains the Prometheus scrape target configuration, as well as authentication, for the cluster.
+
[,yaml]
----
- job_name: redpandaCloud-sample
  static_configs:
    - targets:
        - console-<id>.<identifier>.fmc.cloud.redpanda.com
  metrics_path: /api/cloud/prometheus/public_metrics
  basic_auth:
    username: prometheus
    password: "<prom_pass>"
  scheme: https
----

. Save the YAML configuration to Prometheus replacing the following placeholders:

* `<id>.<identifier>`: ID and identifier from the **HTTPS endpoint**.
* `<prom_pass>`: Copy and paste the onscreen Prometheus password.


+
Metrics from Redpanda endpoints are scraped into Prometheus. The metrics for each data pipeline are labelled by pipeline ID.

== Use Redpanda monitoring examples

For hands-on learning, Redpanda provides a repository with examples of monitoring Redpanda with Prometheus and Grafana: https://github.com/redpanda-data/observability/tree/main/cloud[redpanda-data/observability^].

It includes https://github.com/redpanda-data/observability/blob/main/grafana-dashboards/Redpanda-Connect-Dashboard.json[an example Grafana dashboard for Redpanda Connect^] and a https://github.com/redpanda-data/observability#sandbox-environment[sandbox environment^] in which you launch a Dockerized Redpanda cluster and create a custom workload to monitor with dashboards.
