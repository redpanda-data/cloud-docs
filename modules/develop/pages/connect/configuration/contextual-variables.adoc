:description: Learn about the advantages of using contextual variables, and how to add them to your data pipelines.

== Understanding contextual variables

Contextual variables provide an easy way to access information about the environment in which a data pipeline is running and the pipeline itself. You can add any of the following contextual variables to your pipeline configurations:

|===
| Contextual variable name | Description

| `$\{REDPANDA_BROKERS}`
| The bootstrap server address of the cluster on which the data pipeline is running.

| `$\{REDPANDA_ID}`
| The ID of the cluster on which the data pipeline is running.

| `$\{REDPANDA_REGION}`
| The cloud region where the data pipeline is deployed.

| `$\{REDPANDA_PIPELINE_ID}`
| The ID of the data pipeline that is currently running.

| `$\{REDPANDA_PIPELINE_NAME}`
| The display name of the data pipeline that is currently running.

| `$\{REDPANDA_SCHEMA_REGISTRY_URL}`
| The URL of the Schema Registry associated with the cluster on which the data pipeline is running.

|===

Contextual variables are automatically set at runtime, which means that you can reuse them across multiple pipelines and development environments. For example, if you add the contextual variable `$\{REDPANDA_ID}` to a pipeline configuration, itâ€™s always set to the ID of the cluster on which the data pipeline is running, whether the pipeline is in your development, user acceptance testing, or production environment. This increases the portability of pipeline configurations and reduces maintenance overheads.

You can also use contextual variables to improve data traceability. See the <<example-pipeline-configuration,Example pipeline configuration>> for full details.

== Add contextual variable to a data pipeline

Add a contextual variable to any pipeline configuration using the notation `$\{CONTEXTUAL_VARIABLE_NAME}`, for example:

[,yaml]
----
output:
 kafka_franz:
   seed_brokers:
     - ${REDPANDA_BROKERS}
----

=== Example pipeline configuration

For improved data traceability, the following pipeline configuration adds the data pipeline display name (`$\{REDPANDA_PIPELINE_NAME}`) and ID (`$\{REDPANDA_PIPELINE_ID}`) to all messages that are processed. 

The configuration also uses the `$REDPANDA_BROKERS` contextual variable to automatically populate the bootstrap server address of the cluster on which the pipeline is run, which allows Redpanda Connect to write updated messages to the `data` topic defined in the `kafka_franz` output.

[,yaml]
----
input:
 generate:
   mapping: |
     root.data = "test message"
   interval: 10s

pipeline:
 processors:
 - bloblang: |
     root = this
     root.source = "${REDPANDA_PIPELINE_NAME}"
     root.source_id = "${REDPANDA_PIPELINE_ID}"

output:
 kafka_franz:
   seed_brokers:
   - ${REDPANDA_BROKERS}
   topic: data
   tls:
     enabled: true
   sasl:
   - mechanism: SCRAM-SHA-256
     username: cluster-username
     password: cluster-password
