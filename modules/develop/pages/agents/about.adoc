:description: Learn about the AI Agents available in Redpanda Cloud.

Redpanda AI agents are configurable digital assistants designed to perform specialist tasks autonomously on your behalf. They seamlessly connect large language models (LLMs) to supplementary data sources and tools, for example, knowledge bases, APIs, and web content. These additional data sources and tools are integrated using preconfigured Redpanda Connect pipelines, which form the foundation of all Redpanda's AI agents. No coding is required.
