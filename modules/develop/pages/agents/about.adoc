:description: Learn about the AI Agents available in Redpanda Cloud.

Redpanda AI agents are configurable digital assistants designed to perform specialist tasks autonomously on your behalf. No coding is required. They allow you to enrich responses from large language models (LLMs) using additional data sources and tools, for example, knowledge bases, APIs, and web content. These additional data sources and tools are integrated using preconfigured Redpanda Connect pipelines, which form the foundation of all Redpanda's AI agents.

Try out xref:develop:agents/create-support-agent.adoc[the support agent], which you can configure to use text-based content from any GitHub repository to enhance the responses given by an OpenAI model.
