:description: Reference of cluster configuration properties.

Cluster properties are configuration settings that control the behavior of a Redpanda cluster at a global level. Configuring cluster properties allows you to adapt Redpanda to specific workloads, optimize resource usage, and enable or disable features. For information on how to edit cluster properties, see xref:manage:cluster-maintenance/config-cluster.adoc[].

NOTE: Some properties require a cluster restart for updates to take effect. This triggers a xref:manage:api/cloud-byoc-controlplane-api.adoc#lro[long-running operation] that can take several minutes to complete.
