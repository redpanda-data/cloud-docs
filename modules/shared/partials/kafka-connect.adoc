NOTE: Kafka Connect is automatically enabled on AWS and GCP clusters, which means there is a node running for Kafka Connect even if connectors are not used. To enable Kafka Connect on Azure clusters, see xref:get-started:cluster-types/byoc/azure/create-byoc-cluster-azure.adoc#enable-kafka-connect[Enable Kafka Connect].
