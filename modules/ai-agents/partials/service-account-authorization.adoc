== Service account authorization

When you create an MCP server or AI agent, Redpanda Cloud automatically creates a service account to authenticate requests to your cluster.

=== Default configuration

The service account is created with:

* **Name**: Pre-filled as `cluster-<cluster-id>-<resource-type>-<resource-name>-sa`, where `sa` stands for service account. For example:
** MCP server: `cluster-d5tp5kntujt599ksadgg-mcp-my-test-server-sa`
** AI agent: `cluster-d5tp5kntujt599ksadgg-agent-my-agent-sa`
+
You can customize this name during creation.

* **Role binding**: Cluster scope with Writer role for the cluster where you created the resource. This allows the resource to read and write data, manage topics, and access cluster resources.

=== Manage service accounts

You can view and manage service accounts created for MCP servers and AI agents in *Organization* > *IAM* > *Service accounts*.

The Organization IAM page shows additional details not visible during creation:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Field |Description

|Client ID
|Unique identifier for OAuth2 authentication

|Description
|Optional description of the service account

|Created at
|Timestamp when the service account was created

|Updated at
|Timestamp of the last modification
|===

From this page you can:

* Edit the service account name or description
* View and manage role bindings
* Rotate credentials
* Delete the service account

[NOTE]
====
Deleting a service account removes authentication for the associated MCP server or AI agent. The resource will no longer be able to access cluster data.
====

=== Customize role bindings

The default Writer role provides broad access suitable for most use cases. If you need more restrictive permissions:

. Navigate to *Organization* > *IAM* > *Service accounts*.
. Find the service account for your resource.
. Edit the role bindings to use a more restrictive role or scope.
