== Service account authorization

When you create a glossterm:mcp-server[] or glossterm:ai-agent[], Redpanda Cloud automatically creates a glossterm:service-account[] to glossterm:authentication[authenticate] requests to your glossterm:cluster[].

=== Default configuration

The service account is created with:

* *Name*: Pre-filled as `cluster-<cluster-id>-<resource-type>-<resource-name>-sa`, where `sa` stands for service account. For example:
** MCP server: `cluster-d5tp5kntujt599ksadgg-mcp-my-test-server-sa`
** AI agent: `cluster-d5tp5kntujt599ksadgg-agent-my-agent-sa`
+
You can customize this name during creation.

* *Role binding*: Cluster scope with Writer role for the cluster where you created the resource. This allows the resource to read and write data, manage glossterm:topic[,topics], and access cluster resources.

=== Manage service accounts

You can view and manage service accounts created for MCP servers and AI agents in *Organization* > *IAM* > *Service accounts*.

The Organization IAM page shows additional details not visible during creation:

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
|Field |Description

|Client ID
|Unique identifier for OAuth2 authentication

|Description
|Optional description of the service account

|Created at
|Timestamp when the service account was created

|Updated at
|Timestamp of the last modification
|===

From this page you can:

* Edit the service account name or description
* View and manage role bindings
* Rotate credentials
* Delete the service account

[NOTE]
====
Deleting a service account removes authentication for the associated MCP server or AI agent. The resource can no longer access cluster data.
====

=== Customize role bindings

The default Writer role provides broad access suitable for most use cases. If you need more restrictive permissions:

. Exit the cluster. Navigate to *Organization IAM* > *Service accounts*.
. Find the service account for your resource.
. Edit the role bindings to use a more restrictive role or scope.

For more about roles and permissions, see xref:security:authorization/rbac/rbac.adoc[Role-based access control].
