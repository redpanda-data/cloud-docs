Redpanda Cloud Console::

In the Redpanda Cloud Console:
+
. Navigate to *Agentic* → *AI Gateway* → *Routers*.
. Select a gateway from your list.
. Look for the *Mode* indicator in the gateway details:
+
--
* *AI Hub*: Pre-configured with intelligent routing
* *Custom*: Administrator-configured routing

The mode badge appears prominently in the gateway overview and helps you quickly identify which configuration approach is in use.

Gateway API::
+
Query a gateway's configuration to see its mode:
+
[,bash]
----
curl https://api.redpanda.com/v1/gateways/${GATEWAY_ID} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${REDPANDA_CLOUD_TOKEN}"

{
  "id": "gw_abc123",
  "name": "production-gateway",
  "mode": "ai_hub",  // or "custom"
  "endpoint": "https://gw.ai.panda.com",
  "workspace_id": "ws_xyz789",
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}

The `mode` field indicates whether the gateway uses `ai_hub` (pre-configured) or `custom` (user-configured) mode.
