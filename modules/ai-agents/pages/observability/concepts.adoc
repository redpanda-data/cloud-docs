Redpanda automatically captures execution traces for both AI agents and MCP servers, providing complete observability into how your agentic systems operate.

== What are transcripts

Every agent and MCP server automatically emits OpenTelemetry traces to a topic called `redpanda.otel_traces`. These traces provide detailed observability into operations, creating complete transcripts.

Transcripts capture:

* Tool invocations and results
* Agent reasoning steps
* Data processing operations
* External API calls
* Error conditions
* Performance metrics

With 100% sampling, every operation is captured, creating complete transcripts that you can use for debugging, monitoring, and performance analysis.

== Traces and spans

OpenTelemetry traces provide a complete picture of how a request flows through your system:

* A _trace_ represents the entire lifecycle of a request (for example, a tool invocation from start to finish).
* A _span_ represents a single unit of work within that trace (such as a data processing operation or an external API call).
* A trace contains one or more spans organized hierarchically, showing how operations relate to each other.

== How Redpanda stores traces

The `redpanda.otel_traces` topic stores OpenTelemetry spans in JSON format, following the https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/protocol/[OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP)^] specification. A Protobuf schema named `redpanda.otel_traces-value` is also automatically registered with the topic, enabling clients to deserialize trace data correctly.

The `redpanda.otel_traces` topic and its schema are managed automatically by Redpanda. If you delete either the topic or the schema, they are recreated automatically. However, deleting the topic permanently deletes all trace data, and the topic comes back empty. Do not produce your own data to this topic. It is reserved for OpenTelemetry traces.

=== Topic configuration and lifecycle

The `redpanda.otel_traces` topic has a predefined retention policy. Configuration changes to this topic are not supported. If you modify settings, Redpanda reverts them to the default values.

The topic persists in your cluster even after all agents and MCP servers are deleted, allowing you to retain historical trace data for analysis.

Trace data may contain sensitive information from your tool inputs and outputs. Consider implementing appropriate glossterm:ACL[,access control lists (ACLs)] for the `redpanda.otel_traces` topic, and review the data in traces before sharing or exporting to external systems.

== Understand the trace structure

Each span captures a unit of work. Here's what a typical MCP tool invocation looks like:

[,json]
----
{
    "traceId": "71cad555b35602fbb35f035d6114db54",
    "spanId": "43ad6bc31a826afd",
    "name": "http_processor",
    "attributes": [
        {"key": "city_name", "value": {"stringValue": "london"}},
        {"key": "result_length", "value": {"intValue": "198"}}
    ],
    "startTimeUnixNano": "1765198415253280028",
    "endTimeUnixNano": "1765198424660663434",
    "instrumentationScope": {"name": "rpcn-mcp"},
    "status": {"code": 0, "message": ""}
}
----

Key elements to understand:

* **`traceId`**: Links all spans belonging to the same request. Use this to follow a tool invocation through its entire lifecycle.
* **`name`**: The tool or operation name (`http_processor` in this example). This tells you which component was invoked.
* **`instrumentationScope.name`**: When this is `rpcn-mcp`, the span represents an MCP tool. When it's `redpanda-connect`, it's internal processing.
* **`attributes`**: Context about the operation, like input parameters or result metadata.
* **`status.code`**: `0` means success, `2` means error.

== Parent-child relationships

Traces show how operations relate. A tool invocation (parent) may trigger internal operations (children):

[,json]
----
{
    "traceId": "71cad555b35602fbb35f035d6114db54",
    "spanId": "ed45544a7d7b08d4",
    "parentSpanId": "43ad6bc31a826afd",
    "name": "http",
    "instrumentationScope": {"name": "redpanda-connect"},
    "status": {"code": 0, "message": ""}
}
----

The `parentSpanId` links this child span to the parent tool invocation. Both share the same `traceId`, so you can reconstruct the complete operation.

== Error events in traces

When something goes wrong, traces capture error details:

[,json]
----
{
    "traceId": "71cad555b35602fbb35f035d6114db54",
    "spanId": "ba332199f3af6d7f",
    "parentSpanId": "43ad6bc31a826afd",
    "name": "http_request",
    "events": [
        {
            "name": "event",
            "timeUnixNano": "1765198420254169629",
            "attributes": [{"key": "error", "value": {"stringValue": "type"}}]
        }
    ],
    "status": {"code": 0, "message": ""}
}
----

The `events` array captures what happened and when. Use `timeUnixNano` to see exactly when the error occurred within the operation.

== Traces compared to audit logs

OpenTelemetry traces are designed for observability and debugging, not audit logging or compliance.

Traces provide:

* Hierarchical view of request flow through your system (parent-child span relationships)
* Detailed timing information for performance analysis
* Ability to reconstruct execution paths and identify bottlenecks
* Insights into how operations flow through distributed systems

Traces are not:

* Immutable audit records for compliance purposes
* Designed for "who did what" accountability tracking

For compliance and audit requirements, use the session and task topics for agents, which provide records of agent conversations and execution.
