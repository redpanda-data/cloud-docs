The Transcripts view provides filtering, searching, and navigation capabilities beyond basic timeline and hierarchy visualization. Use these features to efficiently locate and investigate specific execution traces.

== Prerequisites

* Running agent with at least one execution
* (permissions, ACL, auth)

== Navigate the timeline interactively

Use the timeline visualization to quickly identify when errors began or patterns changed, and navigate directly to transcripts from particular timestamps.

////

**When to use interactive timeline:**

* Investigating issues that occurred at known times
* Comparing behavior before and after deployments
* Analyzing execution patterns during specific events
* Correlating traces with external system changes

////

== Filter and search for transcripts

Use filters and search together to narrow down transcripts and quickly locate specific executions.

=== Search for specific traces

The search functionality helps you find traces by operation names, types, or identifiers:

* Search by span names to find specific tools used
* Search by operation types (agent invocations, tool calls, LLM interactions)
* Search by trace IDs when troubleshooting and correlating with other systems

////

**When to use search:**

* Finding traces that invoked a specific tool
* Locating a trace by ID when troubleshooting
* Narrowing to specific operation types

////

=== Filter by service

Service filtering shows only traces from specific agents or MCP servers:

* View executions from a single agent when multiple are running
* Isolate MCP server activity from agent activity
* Compare behavior across different service instances

////

**When to use service filtering:**

* Multiple agents deployed, need to focus on one
* Debugging a specific service
* Comparing activity across services

////

=== Filter by execution status

Status filtering shows traces based on their execution outcome:

* Show successful executions for health checks
* Show only failed executions for error investigation
* Toggle between success and error views to compare and analyze patterns

////

**When to use status filtering:**

* Debugging: Focus on failures to identify error patterns
* Monitoring: Verify recent executions succeeded
* Analysis: Compare successful vs failed execution characteristics

////

=== Adjust time range

Use the time range selector to focus on specific time periods (from the last five minutes up to the last 24 hours):

* View recent executions (for example, over the last hour) to monitor real-time activity
* Expand to longer periods for trend analysis over the last day

////

* Narrow to specific time windows when investigating incidents

**When to use time range adjustment:**

* Investigating issues that occurred at known times
* Analyzing execution patterns over days or weeks
* Focusing on recent activity for real-time monitoring

////

=== Combine multiple filters

Filters work together for precise trace selection:

* Service + Status: View only errors from a specific agent
* Time range + Search: Find tool invocations in a specific window
* All filters: Narrow to exact execution subset

TIP: Apply broad filters first (time range, service) to reduce the trace set, then use search to narrow to specific operations.



NOTE: Basic timeline pattern interpretation (spotting errors, gaps, trends) is covered in xref:ai-agents:agents/monitor-agents.adoc[].

== Inspect span details

Selected spans display detailed information at multiple levels, from high-level summaries to complete raw data. Understanding when to use each view helps you investigate efficiently.

=== Summary view

The summary view provides high-level span information:

* Operation name and type
* Execution duration and outcome
* Key metrics relevant to the operation type

**When to use summary view:**

* Quick status verification
* Duration comparison across operations
* Initial assessment before deeper investigation

**Information typically shown:**

* Total nested operations (span count)
* Execution duration
* Token usage (for LLM operations)
* Operation counts (LLM calls, tool calls)
* Service identification

=== Detailed attributes view

The attributes view shows structured metadata about the span:

* Key-value pairs describing the operation
* Operation-specific parameters and results
* Context information for correlation

**When to use attributes view:**

* Investigating operation parameters and inputs
* Understanding error details and conditions
* Finding correlation identifiers (conversation IDs, trace IDs)
* Analyzing operation-specific metrics

**Common attribute categories:**

* Operation metadata (type, name, provider)
* Timing and performance data
* Input/output information (token counts, parameter values)
* Correlation identifiers
* Error information when applicable

For details on standard attributes, see xref:ai-agents:observability/concepts.adoc#key-attributes-by-layer[].

=== Raw data view

The raw data view provides the complete span structure:

* Full OpenTelemetry span in standard format
* All fields including those not displayed in other views
* Structured data suitable for export or programmatic access

**When to use raw data view:**

* Debugging trace instrumentation
* Exporting span data for external analysis
* Accessing fields not shown in summarized views
* Understanding complete span structure for integration work

**Key elements in raw structure:**

* Trace and span identifiers for correlation
* Precise timestamps
* Complete attribute sets
* Event records (errors, custom events)
* Instrumentation metadata
* Status codes and messages

=== Navigate between views

Different views provide different levels of detail for the same span:

* Start with summary for quick assessment
* Switch to attributes for detailed investigation
* Use raw data when you need complete information

TIP: Different views show the same span data at different levels of detail - select the view that matches your current investigation needs.
