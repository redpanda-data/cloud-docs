The Transcripts view provides filtering, searching, and navigation capabilities for investigating agent and MCP server execution transcripts. Use these features to efficiently locate specific operations, analyze performance patterns, and debug issues across tool invocations, LLM calls, and agent reasoning steps.

For basic orientation on agent and MCP server monitoring, see xref:ai-agents:agents/monitor-agents.adoc[] or xref:ai-agents:mcp/remote/monitor-mcp-servers.adoc[]. For conceptual background on what transcripts capture and how spans are organized hierarchically, see xref:ai-agents:observability/concepts.adoc[].

== Prerequisites

* xref:ai-agents:agents/create-agent.adoc[Running agent] or xref:ai-agents:mcp/remote/quickstart.adoc[MCP server] with at least one execution
* Access to the Transcripts view (requires appropriate permissions to read the `redpanda.otel_traces` topic)

== Navigate the Transcripts interface

=== Use the interactive timeline

Use the timeline visualization to quickly identify when errors began or patterns changed, and navigate directly to transcripts from particular timestamps.

TIP: See xref:ai-agents:agents/monitor-agents.adoc[] and xref:ai-agents:mcp/remote/monitor-mcp-servers.adoc[] to learn basic execution patterns and health indicators to investigate.

=== Search and filter for transcripts

Use search and filters together to narrow down transcripts and quickly locate specific executions.

==== Search for specific transcripts

The search functionality helps you find transcripts by operation names, span types, or identifiers:

* Search by span names to find specific xref:ai-agents:observability/concepts.adoc#agent-span-types[agent operations] like `invoke_agent`, or xref:ai-agents:mcp/remote/create-tool.adoc[MCP tools]
* Search by xref:ai-agents:observability/concepts.adoc#instrumentation-layers[scope] to filter by layer (for example, `rpcn-mcp` for MCP tool spans)
* Search by trace IDs (`traceId`) when correlating with external systems or troubleshooting specific requests

==== Filter by service

Service filtering shows only transcripts from specific agents or MCP servers using the `service.name` resource attribute. See xref:ai-agents:observability/concepts.adoc#cross-service-transcripts[] to understand how transcripts span multiple services.

* View executions from a single agent when multiple are running (service name: `ai-agent`)
* Isolate MCP server activity from agent activity (service name: `mcp-{server-id}`)
* Compare behavior across different service instances

==== Filter by execution status

Status filtering shows transcripts based on their execution outcome:

* Show successful executions for health checks
* Show only failed executions for error investigation
* Toggle between success and error views to compare and analyze patterns

==== Adjust time range

Use the time range selector to focus on specific time periods (from the last five minutes up to the last 24 hours):

* View recent executions (for example, over the last hour) to monitor real-time activity
* Expand to longer periods for trend analysis over the last day
* Narrow to specific time windows when investigating issues that occurred at known times

TIP: Apply broad filters first (time range, service) to reduce the transcript set, then use search to narrow to specific operations.

== Inspect span details

Each row in the transcript table represents a high-level agent or MCP server request flow. Expand each parent span to see the xref:ai-agents:observability/concepts.adoc#agent-transcript-hierarchy[hierarchical structure] of nested operations, including tool calls, LLM interactions, and internal processing steps. Parent-child spans show how operations relate: for example, an agent invocation (parent) triggers LLM calls and tool executions (children).

Selected spans display detailed information at multiple levels, from high-level summaries to complete raw data:

* Start with summary view for quick assessment
* Inspect attributes for detailed investigation
* Use raw data when you need complete information

=== Summary view

The summary panel provides high-level span information:

* Total nested operations (span count) and execution time
* Token usage for LLM operations
* Counts of LLM calls and tool calls

Click on an individual span to drill down into the execution context:

* View the full conversation history saved for that session, including user prompts, configured xref:ai-agents:agents/create-agent.adoc#write-the-system-prompt[system prompts] to guide agent behavior, and LLM outputs
* Inspect individual tool calls made by the agent and any of its sub-agents, including request arguments and responses

TIP: Expand the summary panel to full view to easily read long conversations.

=== Detailed attributes view

The attributes view shows structured metadata for each transcript span. Use this view to quickly locate an attribute value such as conversation ID, then paste it into the search box to find all operations from that conversation session. See xref:ai-agents:observability/concepts.adoc#key-attributes-by-layer[Transcripts and AI Observability] for details on standard attributes by instrumentation layer.

=== Raw data view

The raw data view provides the complete span structure:

* Full OpenTelemetry span in JSON format
* All fields including those not displayed in summary or attributes views
* Structured data suitable for export or programmatic access

You can also view the raw transcript data in the `redpanda.otel_traces` topic.
