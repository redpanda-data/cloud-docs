The Transcripts view provides filtering and navigation capabilities for investigating agent, MCP server, and AI Gateway execution glossterm:transcript[transcripts]. Use this view to quickly locate specific operations, analyze performance patterns, and debug issues across glossterm:tool[] invocations, LLM calls, and glossterm:agent[] reasoning steps.

== Prerequisites

* xref:ai-agents:agents/create-agent.adoc[Running agent] or xref:ai-agents:mcp/remote/quickstart.adoc[MCP server] with at least one execution
* Access to the Transcripts view (requires appropriate permissions to read the `redpanda.otel_traces` topic)

== Navigate the Transcripts interface

=== Use the interactive timeline

Use the timeline visualization to quickly identify when errors began or patterns changed, and navigate directly to transcripts from particular timestamps.

When viewing time periods with many transcripts (hundreds or thousands), the timeline displays a subset of the data to maintain performance and usability. The timeline bar indicates the actual time range of currently visible data, which may be narrower than your <<adjust-time-range,selected time range>>.

TIP: See xref:ai-agents:agents/monitor-agents.adoc[] and xref:ai-agents:mcp/remote/monitor-mcp-servers.adoc[] to learn basic execution patterns and health indicators to investigate.

=== Filter transcripts

Use filters to narrow down transcripts and quickly locate specific executions. When you use any of the filters, the transcript list updates to show only matching results. You can toggle *Full transcript* on to see the complete execution context, in grayed-out text, for the filtered transcripts.  

==== Filter by attribute

// Add details when available

==== Adjust time range

Use the time range selector to focus on specific time periods (from the last five minutes up to the last 24 hours):

* View recent executions (for example, over the last hour) to monitor real-time activity
* Expand to longer periods for trend analysis over the last day
* Narrow to specific time windows when investigating issues that occurred at known times

== Inspect span details

Each row in the transcript table represents a high-level agent or MCP server request flow. Expand each parent glossterm:span[] to see the xref:ai-agents:observability/concepts.adoc#agent-transcript-hierarchy[hierarchical structure] of nested operations, including tool calls, LLM interactions, and internal processing steps. Parent-child spans show how operations relate: for example, an agent invocation (parent) triggers LLM calls and tool executions (children).

When agents invoke remote MCP servers, transcripts fold together under a tree structure to provide a unified view of the complete operation across service boundaries. The glossterm:trace ID[] originates at the initial request touchpoint and propagates across all involved services, linking spans from both the agent and MCP server under a single transcript. Use the tree view to follow the trace flow across multiple services and understand the complete request lifecycle. 

If you use external agents that directly invoke MCP servers in the Redpanda Agentic Data Plane, you may only see MCP-level parent transcripts, unless you have configured the agents to also emit traces to the Redpanda glossterm:OpenTelemetry[OTEL] ingestion pipeline.

Selected spans display detailed information at multiple levels, from high-level summaries to complete raw data:

* Start with summary view for quick assessment
* Inspect attributes for detailed investigation
* Use raw data when you need complete information

=== Summary view

The summary panel provides high-level span information:

* Total nested operations (span count) and execution time
* Token usage for LLM operations
* Counts of LLM calls and tool calls

Click on an individual span to drill down into the execution context:

* View the full conversation history saved for that session, including user prompts, configured xref:ai-agents:agents/create-agent.adoc#write-the-system-prompt[system prompts] to guide agent behavior, and LLM outputs
* Inspect individual tool calls made by the agent and any of its sub-agents, including request arguments and responses

TIP: Expand the summary panel to full view to easily read long conversations.

=== Detailed attributes view

The attributes view shows structured metadata for each transcript span. Use this view to inspect span attributes and understand the context of each operation. See xref:ai-agents:observability/concepts.adoc#key-attributes-by-layer[Transcripts and AI Observability] for details on standard attributes by instrumentation layer.

=== Raw data view

The raw data view provides the complete span structure:

* Full OpenTelemetry span in JSON format
* All fields including those not displayed in summary or attributes views
* Structured data suitable for export or programmatic access

You can also view the raw transcript data in the `redpanda.otel_traces` topic.
