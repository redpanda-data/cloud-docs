This quickstart gets you up and running with your first AI agent using Redpanda Cloud. You'll create a cluster, deploy a simple tool, and connect an AI client.

After reading this page, you will be able to:

* [ ] {learning-objective-3}

== Prerequisites

* Redpanda Cloud account
* Claude Code, Claude Desktop, or another MCP-compatible AI client
* Basic familiarity with YAML

== What you'll build

A simple agent that can query data from a Redpanda topic using a custom MCP tool.

== Create a cluster

. Log in to the Redpanda Cloud Console.
. Create a new cluster.
. During cluster creation, enable Remote MCP.
. Enable the Secrets Store.
. Wait for the cluster to become ready.

For detailed cluster creation steps, see the Redpanda Cloud documentation.

== Deploy your first MCP tool

You'll create a simple tool that queries recent data from a topic.

For step-by-step instructions on creating and deploying MCP tools, see xref:ai-agents:mcp/remote/quickstart.adoc[].

The MCP quickstart walks you through:

* Writing a Redpanda Connect configuration with a component and meta block
* Defining tool parameters and descriptions
* Deploying the tool to your cluster
* Testing tool execution

== Connect your AI client

Once your MCP tool is deployed, connect your AI client:

. Get your cluster's MCP server URL from the Redpanda Cloud Console.
. Configure your AI client with the MCP server URL.
. Authenticate using your Redpanda Cloud credentials.

For client-specific setup instructions, see xref:ai-agents:mcp/remote/quickstart.adoc[].

== Test your agent

Try a natural language query that uses your tool:

[.no-copy]
----
Show me the last 10 messages from the orders topic
----

The agent will:

. Understand your intent
. Discover the available tool
. Invoke the tool with appropriate parameters
. Return formatted results
