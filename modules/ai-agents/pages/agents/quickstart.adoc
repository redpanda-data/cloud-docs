Build your first AI agent in Redpanda Cloud. You'll create an agent that understands natural language requests and uses MCP tools to generate and publish event data to Redpanda topics.

After completing this quickstart, you will be able to:

* [ ] {learning-objective-1}
* [ ] {learning-objective-2}
* [ ] {learning-objective-3}

== Prerequisites

* A xref:get-started:cluster-types/byoc/index.adoc[BYOC cluster] (agents are not available on Dedicated or Serverless clusters)

* Completed the xref:ai-agents:mcp/remote/quickstart.adoc[Remote MCP Quickstart] to create an MCP server with the following tools deployed:
+
** `generate_input`: Generates fake user event data
** `redpanda_output`: Publishes data to Redpanda topics

* API key from one of these providers:
+
** link:https://platform.openai.com/api-keys[OpenAI API key^]
** link:https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys[Anthropic API key^]
** link:https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey[Google AI API key^]

== What you'll build

An Event Data Manager agent that:

* Generates fake user event data (logins, purchases, page views)
* Publishes events to Redpanda topics
* Understands natural language requests like "Generate 5 login events and publish them"

The agent orchestrates the `generate_input` and `redpanda_output` tools you created in the MCP quickstart.

== Create the agent

. Log in to the link:https://cloud.redpanda.com/[Redpanda Cloud Console^].

. Navigate to your cluster and click *Agentic AI* > *AI Agents* in the left navigation.

. Click *Create Agent*.

. Configure basic settings:
+
* *Display Name*: `event-data-manager`
* *Description*: `Generates and publishes fake user event data to Redpanda topics`
* *Resource Tier*: Select *XSmall* (sufficient for this quickstart)

. Choose your LLM provider and model:
+
* *Provider*: Select OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google
* *Model*: Choose any balanced model from the dropdown

. Add your API key:
+
* Click *Add Secret* under *API Key*
* Select *Create new secret*
* *Secret Name*: `<provider>-api-key` (for example, `openai-api-key`)
* *Secret Value*: Paste your API key
* Click *Save*

. Write the system prompt:
+

----
You are an Event Data Manager agent for Redpanda Cloud.

Your responsibilities:
- Generate realistic fake user event data
- Publish events to Redpanda topics
- Help users test streaming data pipelines

Available tools:
- generate_input: Creates fake user events (login, logout, purchase, view)
- redpanda_output: Publishes data to the events topic

When a user asks you to generate events:
1. Use generate_input to create the event data
2. Use redpanda_output to publish the events to Redpanda
3. Confirm how many events were published

Always publish events after generating them unless the user explicitly says not to.

Response format:
- State what you're doing before calling each tool
- Show the generated event data
- Confirm successful publication with a count
----

. Select MCP tools:
+
* Click *Add MCP Server*
* Select the `event-data-generator` server (created in the MCP quickstart)
* Check both tools:
** `generate_input`
** `redpanda_output`

. Set execution parameters:
+
* *Max Iterations*: `30` (allows multiple tool calls per request)

. Review your configuration and click *Create Agent*.

. Wait for the agent status to change from *Starting* to *Running*.

== Test your agent

Now test your agent with natural language requests.

. In the agent details view, open the *Inspector* tab.

. Try these example requests:
+
.Generate and publish 3 events
[%collapsible]
====
[.no-copy]
----
Generate 3 user events and publish them to the events topic.
----

The agent should respond with these steps:

. Call `generate_input` to create 3 fake user events.
. Call `redpanda_output` to publish them to the `events` topic.
. Confirm the events were published.

You should see the agent's reasoning and the tool execution results.
====
+
.Generate specific event types
[%collapsible]
====
[.no-copy]
----
Create 5 login events for testing and publish them to Redpanda.
----

The agent understands the request requires login events specifically and generates appropriate test data.
====
+
.Generate events without publishing
[%collapsible]
====
[.no-copy]
----
Show me what 3 sample purchase events would look like, but don't publish them yet.
----

The agent calls only `generate_input` and displays the data without publishing.
====

. Navigate to *Topics* in the left navigation to verify events were published to the `events` topic.

== Iterate on your agent

Try modifying the agent to change its behavior:

. Click *Edit configuration* in the agent details view.

. Update the system prompt to change how the agent responds. For example:
+
* Add constraints: "Never publish more than 10 events at once"
* Change output format: "Always format events as a table"
* Add validation: "Before publishing, show the user the generated data and ask for confirmation"

. Click *Save* to update the agent.

. Test your changes in the *Inspector* tab.

== Troubleshoot

For comprehensive troubleshooting guidance, see xref:ai-agents:agents/troubleshooting.adoc[].

Common quickstart issues:

**Events not appearing in topic:** Verify the `events` topic exists and review the MCP server logs for publishing errors.
