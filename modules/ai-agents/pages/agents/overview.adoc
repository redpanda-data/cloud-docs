AI agents are systems that combine large language models (LLMs) with the ability to execute actions and process data. Redpanda Cloud provides real-time streaming infrastructure and standardized tool access to support agent development.

== What is an AI agent?

An AI agent is a system built around a large language model that can interpret user intent, decide which actions are required, invoke external tools, process live and historical data, and chain multiple steps into a workflow. AI agents differ from text-only LLMs by executing actions and invoking external tools.

== How agents work

Every AI agent consists of four essential components:

* *System prompt*: Defines the agent's role, responsibilities, and constraints
* *LLM*: Interprets user intent and decides which tools to invoke
* *Tools*: External capabilities exposed through the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
* *Context*: Conversation history, tool results, and real-time events from Redpanda topics

Agents can invoke Redpanda Connect components as tools on-demand. Redpanda Connect pipelines can also invoke agents for event-driven processing. This bidirectional integration supports both interactive workflows and automated streaming.

When a user makes a request, the LLM receives the system prompt and context, decides which tools to invoke, and processes the results. This cycle repeats until the task completes.

For a deeper understanding of how agents execute, manage context, and maintain state, see xref:ai-agents:agents/concepts.adoc[].

== Key benefits

Redpanda Cloud provides real-time streaming data so agents access live events instead of batch snapshots. Remote MCP support enables standardized tool access. Managed infrastructure handles deployment, scaling, and security for you. Low-latency execution means tools run close to your data. Integrated secrets management securely stores API keys and credentials.

== Use cases

AI agents in Redpanda Cloud unlock new capabilities across multiple fields.

=== For AI agent developers

Build agents grounded in real-time data instead of static snapshots. Connect your agent to live order status, inventory levels, and customer history so responses reflect current business state, not stale training data.

=== For application developers

Add conversational AI to existing applications without rebuilding your backend. Expose your services as MCP tools and let agents orchestrate complex multi-step workflows through natural language.

=== For streaming developers

Process every event with AI reasoning at scale. Invoke agents automatically from pipelines for fraud detection, content moderation, or sentiment analysis. No batch jobs, no delayed insights.

== Limitations

* Agents are available only on xref:get-started:cluster-types/byoc/index.adoc[BYOC clusters]
* MCP servers must be hosted in Redpanda Cloud clusters
* Cross-agent calling between separate agents hosted in Redpanda Cloud is not currently supported (use internal subagents for delegation within a single agent)
