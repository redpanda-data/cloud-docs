== What is an AI agent?

An AI agent is a system built around a large language model that can:

* Interpret user intent
* Decide which actions are required
* Invoke external tools
* Process live and historical data
* Chain multiple steps into a workflow

AI agents differ from text-only LLMs by executing actions and invoking external tools.

== Key benefits

Redpanda Cloud provides:

* Real-time streaming data: Access live events instead of batch snapshots
* Remote MCP support: Standardized tool access via Model Context Protocol
* Managed infrastructure: Deployment, scaling, and security handled for you
* Low-latency execution: Tools run close to your data
* Integrated secrets: Securely manage API keys and credentials

== Use cases

Agents built with Redpanda Cloud are ideal for:

* Real-time customer support: Agents that query order history, inventory status, and shipping data from streaming topics
* Operational intelligence: Agents that analyze live metrics and logs to answer questions about system health
* Data enrichment workflows: Agents that augment streaming data with external API calls or database lookups
* Multi-system orchestration: Agents that coordinate actions across multiple services using streaming events as triggers

== Limitations

* Remote MCP requires a Redpanda Cloud cluster
* Tool execution latency depends on data source and processing complexity
* Agent quality depends on LLM selection and system prompt design
