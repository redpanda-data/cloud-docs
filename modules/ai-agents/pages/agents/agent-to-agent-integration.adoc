This page covers external agent integration where Redpanda Cloud agents connect to agents hosted elsewhere using the A2A protocol. For internal integration within Redpanda Cloud (agents invoking MCP tools, or pipelines calling agents), see xref:ai-agents:agents/integration-patterns.adoc[].

== What is the A2A protocol?

The Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol is an open standard for agent communication and discovery. Agents that implement A2A expose their capabilities through a standardized agent card, allowing external systems to discover and interact with them programmatically.

Every Redpanda Cloud agent automatically exposes an agent card at:

----
https://{agent-id}.ai-agents.{cluster-id}.{cluster-domain}/.well-known/agent-card.json
----

The agent card describes:

* **Agent capabilities**: What skills and tools the agent provides
* **Input/output formats**: Expected request and response structures
* **Protocol version**: A2A specification version supported
* **Communication modes**: Synchronous, streaming, or both

For the complete A2A specification, see link:https://a2a.ag/spec[a2a.ag/spec^].

== When to use A2A integration

Use A2A integration when you need:

* **Programmatic access**: Call agents from applications, scripts, or CI/CD pipelines
* **External agent connections**: Connect agents you host elsewhere to Redpanda Cloud agents
* **Custom interfaces**: Build custom UIs or workflows around agent capabilities
* **Multi-system orchestration**: Coordinate agents with other systems in your architecture

For testing and development, use the Redpanda Cloud UI Inspector tab instead. The Inspector automatically handles authentication and provides a testing interface.

== Integration patterns

=== Application-to-agent

Applications send requests to your agent's HTTP endpoint using any A2A-compatible SDK:

----
Application → HTTP/A2A → Redpanda Cloud Agent
----

Use this pattern for:

* Backend services calling agents as part of business logic
* CLI tools that need agent capabilities
* Batch processing systems
* API gateways routing requests to agents

=== External agent-to-agent

Connect agents you host elsewhere to Redpanda Cloud agents:

----
Your Agent → A2A Protocol → Redpanda Cloud Agent
----

Use this pattern for:

* Agent workflows spanning multiple platforms
* Specialized agents you develop and host separately
* Integration with existing agent infrastructure

== Authentication flow

External applications authenticate using OAuth2 client credentials flow with the agent's service account.

=== How authentication works

When you create an agent, Redpanda Cloud automatically creates a service account with a client ID and secret. External applications use these credentials to obtain access tokens:

. **Service account creation**: Agent creation automatically provisions a service account with credentials
. **Token exchange**: Applications exchange the client ID and secret for a time-limited access token via OAuth2
. **Authenticated requests**: Applications include the access token in the Authorization header when calling the agent endpoint
. **Token refresh**: When tokens expire, applications exchange credentials again for a new token

This flow ensures:

* **Credentials are never sent directly to the agent**: Only access tokens are used for agent calls
* **Limited token lifetime**: Tokens expire, reducing the window for compromised credentials
* **Standard OAuth2 protocol**: Applications can use existing OAuth2 libraries

For step-by-step instructions on exchanging credentials for access tokens and making authenticated requests, see xref:security:cloud-authentication.adoc[Cloud API Authentication].

The same OAuth2 client credentials flow used for Redpanda Cloud APIs applies to agent authentication.

== Security considerations

=== Protect service account credentials

* Store client ID and secret in secure credential stores (not in code)
* Use environment variables or secrets management systems
* Rotate credentials if compromised
* Restrict access to credentials based on principle of least privilege

=== Token scope

Access tokens grant full access to the agent. Anyone with a valid token can:

* Send requests to the agent
* Receive responses from the agent
* Consume agent resources (subject to rate limits)

Treat access tokens like passwords. Do not log them or expose them in error messages.
