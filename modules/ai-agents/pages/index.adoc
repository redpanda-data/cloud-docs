The Redpanda Agentic Data Plane platform provides AI agents with secure and governed access to enterprise data by acting as an intermediary layer between the data ecosystem and the agents themselves. It enables agents to safely discover, query, and act on data drawn from a wide range of sources while seamlessly combining real-time and historical context. Governance controls, access policies, and audit trails ensure that all interactions with data are traceable and compliant with organizational standards.
