glossterm:AI agent[,AI agents] in Redpanda Cloud are declarative assistants that perform specialist tasks without requiring you to write Python or JavaScript agent code. You declare the behavior you want by choosing an LLM, defining a system prompt, and connecting tools powered by 300+ built-in Redpanda Connect connectors with robust filtering and data enrichment. The framework handles execution, orchestration, and scaling.

Redpanda Cloud provides two complementary Model Context Protocol (MCP) options to connect agents to data sources and external services.
