AI agents are configurable digital assistants that autonomously perform specialist tasks by leveraging large language models (LLMs) and connecting to external data sources and tools.

Redpanda Cloud provides two complementary Model Context Protocol (MCP) options to help you build AI agents:

**Local MCP server for Redpanda Cloud**: A built-in server that gives your AI assistant direct access to your Redpanda Cloud account and clusters. This runs locally on your computer and lets you quickly perform operations like creating clusters, listing topics, and reading messages.

**Remote MCP (managed)**: Your own custom MCP servers built with Redpanda Connect pipelines and hosted inside your Redpanda Cloud cluster. These let you create reusable tools for your team that integrate with knowledge bases, APIs, and web content while running close to your data.
