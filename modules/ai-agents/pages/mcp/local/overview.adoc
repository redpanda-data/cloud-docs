== What you can do

MCP provides controlled access to:

* link:https://docs.redpanda.com/api/doc/cloud-controlplane/[Control Plane] APIs, such as creating a Redpanda Cloud cluster or listing clusters.
* link:https://docs.redpanda.com/api/doc/cloud-dataplane/[Data Plane] APIs, such as creating topics or listing topics.

The MCP server runs on your computer and authenticates to Redpanda Cloud using a Redpanda Cloud token.

You can do anything that's available in the Control Plane or Data Plane APIs. Typical requests you can make to your assistant once connected include:

* Create a Redpanda Cloud cluster named `dev-mcp`.
* List topics in `dev-mcp`.
* Create a topic `orders-raw` with 6 partitions.

NOTE: The MCP server does **not** expose delete endpoints by default. You can enable delete endpoints when you create the server if you intentionally want to allow delete operations.

== Use cases

* Test automation: Create short-lived clusters, create topics, and validate pipelines quickly.
* Operational assistance: Inspect a cluster's health or list topics during incidents.
* Onboarding and demos: Let team members issue high-level requests without memorizing every CLI flag.

== How it works

. Authenticate to Redpanda Cloud and receive a token using the xref:reference:rpk/rpk-cloud/rpk-cloud-login.adoc[`rpk cloud login` command].
. Configure your MCP client using the xref:reference:rpk/rpk-cloud/rpk-cloud-mcp-install.adoc[`rpk cloud mcp install`] command. Your client then starts the server on-demand using xref:reference:rpk/rpk-cloud/rpk-cloud-mcp-stdio.adoc[`rpk cloud mcp stdio`], authenticating with the Redpanda Cloud token from `rpk cloud login`.
. Prompt your assistant to perform Redpanda operations. The MCP server executes them in your Redpanda Cloud account using your Redpanda Cloud token.

=== Components

The Redpanda Cloud Management MCP Server requires these components:

* AI client (Claude, Claude Code, or any other MCP client) that connects to the MCP server.
* Redpanda CLI (`rpk`) for obtaining a token and starting the MCP server.
* Redpanda Cloud account that the MCP server can connect to and issue API requests.

== Security considerations

MCP servers authenticate to Redpanda Cloud using your personal or service account credentials. However, there is **no auditing or access control** that distinguishes between actions performed by MCP servers versus direct API calls:

* All API actions appear in Redpanda Cloud's internal logs as coming from the authenticated user account, not the specific MCP server.
* You cannot audit which MCP server performed which operations, as Redpanda Cloud logs are not accessible to users.
* You cannot restrict specific MCP servers to only certain API endpoints or resources.

TIP: The Redpanda documentation site has a read-only MCP server that provides access to Redpanda docs and examples. This server has no access to your Redpanda Cloud account or clusters. See xref:home:ROOT:mcp-setup.adoc[].
