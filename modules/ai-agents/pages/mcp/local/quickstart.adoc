// Reader journey: "I'm new" → first hands-on experience
// Learning objectives - what readers will achieve by completing this quickstart:
:learning-objective-1: Authenticate to Redpanda Cloud with rpk
:learning-objective-2: Install the MCP integration for Claude
:learning-objective-3: Issue natural language commands to manage clusters

In this quickstart, you'll get your Claude AI agent talking to Redpanda Cloud using the xref:ai-agents:mcp/local/overview.adoc[Redpanda Cloud Management MCP Server].

If you're trying to deploy your own MCP server as a managed service inside your cluster, see xref:ai-agents:mcp/remote/quickstart.adoc[].

After completing this quickstart, you will be able to:

* [ ] {learning-objective-1}
* [ ] {learning-objective-2}
* [ ] {learning-objective-3}

== Prerequisites

* At least version 25.2.3 of xref:manage:rpk/rpk-install.adoc[`rpk` installed on your computer]
* Access to a Redpanda Cloud account
* link:https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/10065433-installing-claude-desktop[Claude] or link:https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/setup[Claude Code] installed
+
TIP: For other clients, see xref:ai-agents:mcp/local/configuration.adoc[].

== Set up the MCP server

. Verify your `rpk` version
+
```bash
rpk version
```
+
Ensure the version is at least 25.2.3.

. Log in to Redpanda Cloud
+
```bash
rpk cloud login
```
+
A browser window opens. Sign in to grant access. After you sign in, `rpk` stores a token locally. This token is not shared with your AI agent. It is used by the MCP server to authenticate requests to your Redpanda Cloud account.

. Install the MCP integration. Choose one client:
+
```bash
# Claude desktop
rpk cloud mcp install --client claude

# Claude Code (IDE)
rpk cloud mcp install --client claude-code
```
+
This command configures the MCP server for your client. If you need to update the integration, re-run the install command for your client.

== Start prompting

Launch Claude or Claude Code and try one of these prompts:

* “Create a Redpanda Cloud cluster named `dev-mcp`.”
* “List topics in `dev-mcp`.”
* “Create a topic `orders-raw` with 6 partitions.”

:note-caption: Delete operations are opt-in

NOTE: The MCP server does *not* expose API endpoints that result in delete operations by default. Use `--allow-delete` only if you intentionally want to enable delete operations. See xref:ai-agents:mcp/local/configuration.adoc#enable_delete_operations[Enable delete operations].
