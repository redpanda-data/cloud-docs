= MCP in Redpanda Cloud
:description: Learn about Model Context Protocol (MCP) in Redpanda Cloud, including the two complementary options: Redpanda Cloud MCP Server and Remote MCP (managed).


Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a way to give AI assistants like Claude access to tools and data they wouldn't normally have. Instead of just chatting with your AI assistant, you can ask it to perform real tasks on your behalf.

== Why use MCP with Redpanda Cloud?

With MCP, you can have natural conversations with your AI assistant about your streaming data infrastructure. Rather than remembering command-line syntax or navigating through web interfaces, you describe what you want in plain language and your AI assistant handles the technical details.

== MCP options in Redpanda Cloud

TIP: The Redpanda documentation site includes a read-only MCP server that gives you access to Redpanda documentation and code examples through AI assistants like Claude Desktop. This server only provides access to public documentation content. It cannot access your Redpanda Cloud account, clusters, or any private data. This is useful for getting help with Redpanda concepts and examples without connecting your actual Redpanda environment. For setup instructions, see xref:home:ROOT:mcp-setup.adoc[].

== Which should I use?

Use the **Redpanda Cloud MCP Server** to operate your Redpanda Cloud account quickly from your laptop.

Use the **Remote MCP** to provide reusable tools for your team, running inside the cluster, authored with Redpanda Connect.
