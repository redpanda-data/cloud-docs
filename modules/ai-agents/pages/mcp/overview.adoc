== What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way for AI agents to connect with external data sources and tools in Redpanda Cloud.

Each MCP server hosts a set of tools that AI clients can discover and invoke. Tools are custom integrations that expose data, APIs, or workflows to AI agents.

Think of MCP like a universal adapter: instead of building custom integrations for every AI system, you define your tools once using MCP, and any MCP-compatible AI client can discover and use them.

Without MCP, connecting AI to your business systems requires custom API code, authentication handling, and response formatting for each AI platform. With MCP, you describe what a tool does and what inputs it needs, and the protocol handles the rest.

== MCP options in Redpanda Cloud

Redpanda Cloud offers two complementary MCP options:

Redpanda Cloud Management MCP Server badge::[label=beta, tooltip={page-beta-text}]::
A pre-built server that gives AI agents access to Redpanda Cloud APIs. It runs on your computer and lets you manage clusters, topics, and other resources through natural language.
+
Example: "Create a cluster called `dev-analytics` with 3 brokers."

Remote MCP::
Your own MCP server built with Redpanda Connect and hosted inside your Redpanda Cloud cluster. You define custom tools that access your data, call external APIs, or trigger workflows.
+
Example: "Analyze the last 100 orders and show me the top product categories."

== Which should I use?

Choose based on what you want to accomplish:

**Use the Redpanda Cloud Management MCP Server** when you want to:

* Manage Redpanda Cloud resources without memorizing CLI commands
* Quickly create test clusters, topics, or users
* Inspect cluster health during incidents
* Onboard team members who prefer natural language over APIs

**Use Remote MCP** when you want to:

* Build tools that access your business data in Redpanda topics
* Create reusable tools shared across your team
* Connect AI agents to external systems (databases, APIs, LLMs)
* Run tools close to your data with managed infrastructure

You can use both options together. For example, use the Redpanda Cloud Management MCP Server to create a cluster, then deploy Remote MCP tools to analyze data in that cluster.
