**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a way to give AI assistants like Claude access to tools and data they wouldn't normally have. Instead of just chatting with your AI assistant, you can ask it to perform real tasks on your behalf.

== Why use MCP with Redpanda Cloud?

With MCP, you can have natural conversations with your AI assistant about your streaming data infrastructure. Rather than remembering command-line syntax or navigating through web interfaces, you describe what you want in plain English and your AI assistant handles the technical details.

== MCP options in Redpanda Cloud

In Redpanda Cloud, there are two complementary options to use MCP:

| Where it runs
| Your computer
| In your Redpanda Cloud cluster (managed by Redpanda)

| Who builds it
| Redpanda
| You, with Redpanda Connect

| Example use cases (prompts you might ask)
| - Create a new cluster called `dev-analytics` for testing.

TIP: The Redpanda documentation site also has a read-only MCP server that provides access to Redpanda docs and examples. This server has no access to your Redpanda Cloud account or clusters. See xref:home:ROOT:mcp-setup.adoc[].

== Which should I use?

Use the **local MCP server for Redpanda Cloud** to operate your Redpanda Cloud account quickly from your laptop.

Use the **remote MCP** to provide reusable tools for your team, running inside the cluster, authored with Redpanda Connect.
