== What is Remote MCP?

Remote MCP lets you build and host MCP servers in your Redpanda Cloud clusters. Your tools run next to your data, managed by Redpanda, so you get:

* *Always-on availability:* No local process to run. Your tools are hosted and managed by Redpanda Cloud.
* *Proximity to data:* Tools execute next to your cluster for lower latency and simpler networking.
* *Secure secrets management:* Use the xref:develop:connect/configuration/secret-management.adoc[Secrets Store] instead of hardcoding credentials.
* *Fast iteration:* Define tools as YAML, deploy, and your AI agents can use them immediately.

== How it works

Remote MCP servers sit between AI clients and your data:

. Your AI agent connects to your MCP server using `rpk cloud mcp proxy` or direct authentication
. A user asks their AI agent something like "What's the weather in London?"
. The server finds the matching tool and runs your Redpanda Connect configuration
. Your configuration fetches data, transforms it, and returns a structured response
. The AI agent gets the data and can use it to answer the user

=== What a tool looks like

A tool is a YAML configuration with two parts: the logic (what the tool does) and the metadata (how AI understands it).

Here's a minimal example that returns weather data:

[source,yaml]
----
http:
  url: "https://wttr.in/${! this.city }?format=j1"
  verb: GET

meta:
  mcp:
    enabled: true
    name: get_weather
    description: "Get current weather for a city"
    properties:
      - name: city
        type: string
        description: "City name"
        required: true
----

When an AI client asks about weather, it calls this tool with the city name. The tool fetches data from the weather API and returns it.
