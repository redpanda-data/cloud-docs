Remote MCP servers are managed, hosted Model Context Protocol servers that run inside your Redpanda Cloud cluster. Unlike the xref:ai-agents:mcp/local/overview.adoc[local MCP server for Redpanda Cloud], remote servers are deployed to your cluster and operated by Redpanda. Your server can include one or more tools that you write using Redpanda Connect pipelines.

== Why use remote MCP?

* *Always-on and centrally managed:* No need to run a local process. Your tools live with your data.
* *Proximity to data:* Execute tools next to your cluster for lower latency and simpler networking.
* *Secure by design:* Use the xref:develop:connect/configuration/secret-management.adoc[Secrets Store]. Never hardcode secrets in pipelines.

== Architecture

* *Build*: You describe tools as Redpanda Connect components with `meta.mcp` metadata.
* *Host*: Redpanda Cloud runs your server within the target cluster using the resources you select.
* *Access*: Clients such as Claude Code connect and authenticate using either the MCP proxy or direct connections.

== Core concepts

The remote MCP server is a managed service that runs inside your Redpanda Cloud cluster. You create and deploy the server using the Redpanda Cloud Console or the API.

=== Redpanda Connect

Remote MCP servers are implemented as Redpanda Connect pipelines. Your tools:

* Use processors for request/response logic.
* Can access brokers using the `$\{REDPANDA_BROKERS}` environment variable (the pipeline is hosted within the cluster).

=== Secrets

* Store secrets in the xref:develop:connect/configuration/secret-management.adoc[Secrets Store] and reference them in configs as `${secrets.MY_SECRET_NAME}`.
* *Never* include secrets in plain text within pipelines or MCP server definitions.
* Secret names should be *UPPER_CASE snake_case*.

=== Linting and validation

Always use the *Lint* action before deploying to ensure the configuration compiles and required parameters are present.

== How it works

. **Authentication:** The AI client (such as Claude Code) must authenticate to Redpanda Cloud and receive a token. You can do this by using either the MCP proxy or by implementing the MCP client flow yourself.
.. *MCP proxy*: For tools with built-in MCP clients, first authenticate with `rpk cloud login`, then configure them to use the `rpk cloud mcp proxy` command. This command handles proxying requests to the remote MCP server running in your Redpanda Cloud cluster using your stored authentication token.
.. **Direct option:** If you are building your own AI agent, you can implement the MCP client flow yourself and connect directly to the remote MCP server, handling authentication and requests without `rpk`.
. **Prompting:** After connecting, you can prompt your assistant to perform operations using your remote MCP server.
