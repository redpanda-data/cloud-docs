= About Remote MCP Servers for Redpanda Cloud
:description: Discover how AI assistants can interact with your streaming data and how to connect them to Redpanda Cloud.

Remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers are hosted MCP servers that run inside your Redpanda Cloud cluster. They let you expose your data, analytics, and automation pipelines as AI-consumable tools with no custom API code. MCP servers bridge your business logic to AI agents using the open MCP standard, so you can:

* Make your data and workflows accessible to AI assistants and LLMs, safely and on your terms.
* Accelerate automation and insight by letting AI trigger real business actions.
* Control exposure so that only the tools you tag are visible to AI.

== Why use a Remote MCP server?

* *Always-on and centrally managed*: No need to run a local process. Your tools live with your data, managed by Redpanda.
* *Proximity to data*: Execute tools next to your cluster for lower latency and simpler networking.
* *Secure by design*: Use the xref:develop:connect/configuration/secret-management.adoc[Secrets Store]. Never hardcode secrets in your YAML configuration.
* *Fast iteration*: Define tools as YAML configuration, deploy your MCP server, and your AI agents can use the new logic instantly.

== How it works

. Build your tools as Redpanda Connect configurations with `meta.mcp` metadata (description, properties, and logic).
. Deploy to your cluster. Redpanda Cloud hosts your MCP server with secure access.
. Connect your AI client. AI assistants authenticate, discover available tools, and invoke them using natural language prompts.

== Authentication options

- **MCP proxy (recommended):** For tools with built-in MCP clients like Claude Code:
+
[,bash]
----
rpk cloud login
rpk cloud mcp proxy --install --client claude-code --cluster-id <cluster-id> --mcp-server-id <server-id>
----

- **Direct connection:** If building your own AI agent, implement the MCP client flow yourself and connect directly to the Remote MCP server.
