MCP tools use an agent-initiated execution model where agents invoke tools on-demand. Redpanda also supports pipeline-initiated integration where pipelines call agents using the `a2a_message` processor. For guidance on choosing between these patterns, see xref:ai-agents:agents/integration-overview.adoc[].

== Choose the right component type

== Observability

MCP servers automatically emit OpenTelemetry traces for monitoring and debugging. For detailed information about traces, spans, and the trace structure, see xref:ai-agents:observability/concepts.adoc[].

To monitor MCP server activity, consume traces, and debug failures, see xref:ai-agents:mcp/remote/monitor-mcp-servers.adoc[].
