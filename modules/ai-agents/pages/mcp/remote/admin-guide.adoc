== Server lifecycle management

Manage the basic lifecycle of your MCP servers, including editing configurations, pausing to save costs, and deleting.

See xref:ai-agents:mcp/remote/manage-servers.adoc[].

== Resource scaling

Adjust your MCP server's compute resources to match workload demands and optimize costs. Resource allocation directly affects your billing charges.

See xref:ai-agents:mcp/remote/scale-resources.adoc[].

== Monitoring and observability

Monitor your MCP server's activity using OpenTelemetry traces. Track tool invocations, measure performance, debug failures, and integrate with observability platforms.

See xref:ai-agents:mcp/remote/monitor-activity.adoc[].
