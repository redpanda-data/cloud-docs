= Manage Remote MCP Servers
:description: Learn how to manage, edit, stop, resume, and delete Remote MCP servers in Redpanda Cloud.


This guide is for Redpanda Cloud administrators who need to manage the lifecycle of Remote MCP servers.

== Prerequisites

You must have an existing MCP server. If you do not have one, see xref:ai-agents:mcp/remote/quickstart.adoc[].

== Edit an existing MCP server

You can update the configuration, resources, or metadata of a Remote MCP server at any time.

. In the Redpanda Cloud Console, navigate to *Remote MCP*.
. Find the MCP server you want to edit and click its name.
. Click *Edit configuration*.
. Make your changes.
. Click *Save* to apply changes.

[NOTE]
====
Editing a running MCP server may cause a brief interruption. Review changes before deploying to production.
====

== Stop (pause) an MCP server

Pausing a server stops all tool execution and releases compute resources, but preserves configuration and state.

. In the *Remote MCP* list, find the server you want to stop.
. Click the three dots and select *Stop*.
. Confirm the action.

[NOTE]
====
While stopped, the server does not respond to MCP requests. Start it again to restore service.
====

== Resume a stopped MCP server

. In the *Remote MCP* list, find the stopped server.
. Click the three dots and select *Start*.
. Wait for the status to show *Running* before reconnecting clients.

== Delete an MCP server

Deleting a server is permanent and cannot be undone.

. In the *Remote MCP* list, find the server to delete.
. Click the three dots and select *Delete*.
. Confirm the deletion when prompted.

== API and automation

All of these actions can also be performed using the Redpanda Cloud API version v1alpha3. See the link:https://github.com/redpanda-data/console/blob/master/proto/gen/openapi/openapi.v1alpha3.yaml[OpenAPI specification file] for endpoints to manage MCP servers.
