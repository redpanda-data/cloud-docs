This guide provides an overview of administrative tasks for MCP servers. Use these resources to manage your MCP servers throughout their lifecycle, from creation to deletion.

== Prerequisites

You must have an existing MCP server. If you do not have one, see xref:ai-agents:mcp/remote/quickstart.adoc[].

== Server lifecycle management

Manage the basic lifecycle of your MCP servers, including editing configurations, pausing to save costs, and deleting.

See xref:ai-agents:mcp/remote/manage-servers.adoc[].

== Resource scaling

Adjust your MCP server's compute resources to match workload demands and optimize costs. Resource allocation directly affects your billing charges.

See xref:ai-agents:mcp/remote/scale-resources.adoc[].

== Monitoring and observability

Monitor your MCP server's activity using OpenTelemetry traces. Track tool invocations, measure performance, debug failures, and integrate with observability platforms.

See xref:ai-agents:mcp/remote/monitor-activity.adoc[].

== Data Plane API

All administrative tasks can be performed through both the Redpanda Cloud Console UI and the Data Plane API. The Data Plane API is useful for:

* Automation and Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
* CI/CD pipeline integration
* Custom tooling and scripts
* Programmatic management at scale

To use the Data Plane API:

. link:/api/doc/cloud-dataplane/topic/topic-quickstart[Authenticate and get the base URL] for the Data Plane API.
. Use the appropriate endpoint for your task:
+
* link:/api/doc/cloud-dataplane/operation/operation-mcpserverservice_updatemcpserver[`PATCH /v1/redpanda-connect/mcp-servers/\{mcp_server_id}`]: Update configuration
* link:/api/doc/cloud-dataplane/operation/operation-mcpserverservice_stopmcpserver[`POST /v1/redpanda-connect/mcp-servers/\{mcp_server_id}:stop`]: Stop server
* link:/api/doc/cloud-dataplane/operation/operation-mcpserverservice_startmcpserver[`POST /v1/redpanda-connect/mcp-servers/\{mcp_server_id}:start`]: Start server
* link:/api/doc/cloud-dataplane/operation/operation-mcpserverservice_deletemcpserver[`DELETE /v1/redpanda-connect/mcp-servers/\{mcp_server_id}`]: Delete server

[NOTE]
====
Access tokens expire after 1 hour. To refresh, make the authentication request again with your service account credentials. The same token works for both Control Plane and Data Plane API requests.
