This guide is for Redpanda Cloud administrators who need to manage the lifecycle of remote MCP servers.

== Prerequisites

You must have an existing MCP server. If you do not have one, see xref:ai-agents:mcp/remote/quickstart.adoc[].

== Edit an existing MCP server

You can update the configuration, resources, or metadata of a remote MCP server at any time.

. In the Redpanda Cloud Console, navigate to *Remote MCP*.
. Find the MCP server you want to edit and click its name.
. Click *Edit configuration*.
. Make your changes.
. Click *Save* to apply changes.

[NOTE]
====
Editing a running MCP server may cause a brief interruption. Review changes before deploying to production.
====

== Stop (pause) an MCP server

Pausing a server stops all tool execution and releases compute resources, but preserves configuration and state.

. In the *Remote MCP* list, find the server you want to stop.
. Click the three dots and select *Stop*.
. Confirm the action.

[NOTE]
====
While stopped, the server does not respond to MCP requests. Start it again to restore service.
====

== Resume a stopped MCP server

. In the *Remote MCP* list, find the stopped server.
. Click the three dots and select *Start*.
. Wait for the status to show *Running* before reconnecting clients.

== Delete an MCP server

Deleting a server is permanent and cannot be undone.

. In the *Remote MCP* list, find the server to delete.
. Click the three dots and select *Delete*.
. Confirm the deletion when prompted.

== API and automation

All of these actions can also be performed using the Redpanda Cloud API version v1alpha3. See the link:https://github.com/redpanda-data/console/blob/master/proto/gen/openapi/openapi.v1alpha3.yaml[OpenAPI specification file] for endpoints to manage MCP servers.
