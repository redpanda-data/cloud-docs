:description: Overview of administrative tasks for managing Remote MCP servers in Redpanda Cloud.

This guide provides an overview of administrative tasks for Remote MCP servers. Use these resources to manage your MCP servers throughout their lifecycle, from creation to deletion.

== Prerequisites

You must have an existing MCP server. If you do not have one, see xref:ai-agents:mcp/remote/quickstart.adoc[].

== Server lifecycle management

Manage the basic lifecycle of your MCP servers, including editing configurations, pausing to save costs, and permanent deletion.

See xref:ai-agents:mcp/remote/manage-servers.adoc[].

== Resource scaling

Adjust your MCP server's compute resources to match workload demands and optimize costs. Resource allocation directly affects your billing charges.

See xref:ai-agents:mcp/remote/scale-resources.adoc[].

== Monitoring and observability

Monitor your MCP server's activity using OpenTelemetry traces. Track tool invocations, measure performance, debug failures, and integrate with observability platforms.

See xref:ai-agents:mcp/remote/monitor-activity.adoc[].

== Data Plane API

All administrative tasks can be performed through both the Redpanda Cloud Console UI and the Data Plane API. The Data Plane API is useful for:

* Automation and Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
* CI/CD pipeline integration
* Custom tooling and scripts
* Programmatic management at scale

To use the Data Plane API:

. link:/api/doc/cloud-dataplane/topic/topic-quickstart[Authenticate and get the base URL] for the Data Plane API.
. Use the appropriate endpoint for your task:
+
* link:/api/doc/cloud-dataplane/operation/operation-mcpserverservice_updatemcpserver[`PATCH /v1/redpanda-connect/mcp-servers/\{mcp_server_id}`]: Update configuration
* link:/api/doc/cloud-dataplane/operation/operation-mcpserverservice_stopmcpserver[`POST /v1/redpanda-connect/mcp-servers/\{mcp_server_id}:stop`]: Stop server
* link:/api/doc/cloud-dataplane/operation/operation-mcpserverservice_startmcpserver[`POST /v1/redpanda-connect/mcp-servers/\{mcp_server_id}:start`]: Start server
* link:/api/doc/cloud-dataplane/operation/operation-mcpserverservice_deletemcpserver[`DELETE /v1/redpanda-connect/mcp-servers/\{mcp_server_id}`]: Delete server

[NOTE]
====
Access tokens expire after 1 hour. To refresh, make the authentication request again with your service account credentials. The same token works for both Control Plane and Data Plane API requests.
