== Prerequisites

You must have an existing MCP server. If you do not have one, see xref:ai-agents:mcp/remote/quickstart.adoc[].

== Edit an MCP server

You can update the configuration, resources, or metadata of an MCP server at any time.

[tabs]
=====
Cloud Console::
+
--
. In the Redpanda Cloud Console, navigate to *Remote MCP*.
. Find the MCP server you want to edit and click its name.
. Click *Edit configuration*.
. Make your changes.
. Click *Save* to apply changes.

[NOTE]
====
Editing a running MCP server may cause a brief interruption. Review changes before deploying to production.

Data Plane API::

. link:/api/doc/cloud-dataplane/topic/topic-quickstart[Authenticate and get the base URL] for the Data Plane API.
. Make a request to link:/api/doc/cloud-dataplane/operation/operation-mcpserverservice_getmcpserver[`GET /v1/redpanda-connect/mcp-servers/\{mcp_server_id}`] to retrieve the current configuration.
. Make a request to link:/api/doc/cloud-dataplane/operation/operation-mcpserverservice_updatemcpserver[`PATCH /v1/redpanda-connect/mcp-servers/\{mcp_server_id}`] to update the configuration:
+
[,bash]
----
curl -X PATCH "https://<dataplane-api-url>/v1/redpanda-connect/mcp-servers/<mcp-server-id>?update_mask=display_name,description" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

    "mcp_server": {
      "display_name": "updated-name",
      "description": "Updated description"
    }
  }'

== Stop an MCP server

Stopping a server pauses all tool execution and releases compute resources, but preserves configuration and state. This is useful for temporarily disabling a server to save costs while retaining the ability to restart it later.

[tabs]
=====
Cloud Console::
+
--
. In the Redpanda Cloud Console, navigate to *Remote MCP*.
. Find the server you want to stop.
. Click the three dots and select *Stop*.
. Confirm the action.

Data Plane API::
+
--
. link:/api/doc/cloud-dataplane/topic/topic-quickstart[Authenticate and get the base URL] for the Data Plane API.
. Make a request to link:/api/doc/cloud-dataplane/operation/operation-mcpserverservice_stopmcpserver[`POST /v1/redpanda-connect/mcp-servers/\{mcp_server_id}:stop`]:
+
[,bash]
----
curl -X POST "https://<dataplane-api-url>/v1/redpanda-connect/mcp-servers/<mcp-server-id>:stop" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

While stopped, the server cannot respond to MCP requests. Start it to restore service.

== Start a stopped MCP server

Resume a stopped server to restore its functionality.

[tabs]
=====
Cloud Console::
+
--
. In the Redpanda Cloud Console, navigate to *Remote MCP*.
. Find the stopped server.
. Click the three dots and select *Start*.
. Wait for the status to show *Running* before reconnecting clients.

Data Plane API::

. link:/api/doc/cloud-dataplane/topic/topic-quickstart[Authenticate and get the base URL] for the Data Plane API.
. Make a request to link:/api/doc/cloud-dataplane/operation/operation-mcpserverservice_startmcpserver[`POST /v1/redpanda-connect/mcp-servers/\{mcp_server_id}:start`]:
+
[,bash]
----
curl -X POST "https://<dataplane-api-url>/v1/redpanda-connect/mcp-servers/<mcp-server-id>:start" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

== Delete an MCP server

Deleting a server permanently removes it. You cannot undo this action. Redpanda removes all configuration, tools, and associated resources.

[tabs]
=====
Cloud Console::
+
--
. In the Redpanda Cloud Console, navigate to *Remote MCP*.
. Find the server you want to delete.
. Click the three dots and select *Delete*.
. Confirm the deletion when prompted.
--

Data Plane API::
+
--
. link:/api/doc/cloud-dataplane/topic/topic-quickstart[Authenticate and get the base URL] for the Data Plane API.
. Make a request to link:/api/doc/cloud-dataplane/operation/operation-mcpserverservice_deletemcpserver[`DELETE /v1/redpanda-connect/mcp-servers/\{mcp_server_id}`]:
+
[,bash]
----
curl -X DELETE "https://<dataplane-api-url>/v1/redpanda-connect/mcp-servers/<mcp-server-id>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

[WARNING]
====
Deletion is immediate and permanent. Make sure you have backed up any important configuration before deleting an MCP server.
