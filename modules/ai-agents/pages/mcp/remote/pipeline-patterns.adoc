= Patterns for Remote MCP Servers
:description: Catalog of patterns for Remote MCP server tools in Redpanda Cloud.
:page-beta: true

This page provides a reference catalog of patterns designed for use with Remote MCP servers in Redpanda Cloud. Use these patterns as building blocks for your own MCP tools. For step-by-step instructions on building, deploying, and testing MCP servers, see xref:ai-agents:mcp/remote/developer-guide.adoc[].

Each pattern is a reusable example for a common MCP tool scenario. Patterns are grouped by use case. All YAML is ready to use in your MCP server project.

For a high-level overview of MCP servers, see xref:ai-agents:mcp/overview.adoc[].

== Data generators

Use xref:develop:connect/components/inputs/about.adoc[`inputs`] to create tools that read data from internal or external systems or generate sample data for testing and development.

This example generates a realistic user event message:

[source,yaml]
----
include::ai-agents:example$generate_input.yaml[]
----

See also: xref:develop:connect/components/inputs/generate.adoc[`generate` input component]

== External API calls

Use xref:develop:connect/components/processors/about.adoc[`processors`] to fetch data from external APIs, databases, or services and return formatted results. This is one of the most common patterns for MCP tools.

[source,yaml]
----
include::ai-agents:example$http_processor.yaml[]
----

See also: xref:develop:connect/components/processors/http.adoc[`http` processor], xref:develop:connect/components/processors/mutation.adoc[`mutation` processor]

== Database queries

Query external databases and return structured results. This pattern is essential for tools that need to access business data.

[source,yaml]
----
include::ai-agents:example$gcp_bigquery_select_processor.yaml[]
----

See also: xref:develop:connect/components/processors/gcp_bigquery_select.adoc[`gcp_bigquery_select` processor], xref:develop:connect/components/processors/sql_select.adoc[`sql_select` processor] (for other databases)

=== Redpanda integration and data publishing

Use these patterns when you need to integrate with Redpanda infrastructure, publish data to topics, or implement caching systems.

=== Data publishers (output patterns)

Use xref:develop:connect/components/outputs/about.adoc[`outputs`] to send data to external systems or build caching systems.

This example publishes a message to a Redpanda topic:

[source,yaml]
----
include::ai-agents:example$redpanda_output.yaml[]
----

See also: xref:develop:connect/components/outputs/redpanda.adoc[`redpanda` output]

=== Caching systems

Use caching to store frequently accessed data, reduce latency, and minimize external API calls. You can implement caching using either Redpanda topics or in-memory stores.

[source,yaml]
----
include::ai-agents:example$redpanda_cache.yaml[]
----

This example implements an in-memory cache for low-latency access to small datasets:

[source,yaml]
----
include::ai-agents:example$memory_cache.yaml[]
----

See also: xref:develop:connect/components/caches/memory.adoc[`memory` cache], Redpanda-backed cache using xref:develop:connect/components/outputs/redpanda.adoc[`redpanda` output]
