AI agents need context from your business systems. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) translates agent intent into real connections to databases, queues, CRMs, HRIS, and other systems of record, without you writing custom integration code. Redpanda's MCP servers are built on the same proven connectors that power the world's largest e-commerce, electric vehicle, energy, and AI companies.

Redpanda Cloud offers two complementary MCP options:

* *Remote MCP*: Deploy MCP servers directly in Redpanda Cloud for scalable, managed AI agent integrations
* *Redpanda Cloud Management MCP Server*: Connect your local AI development environment to manage Redpanda Cloud resources
