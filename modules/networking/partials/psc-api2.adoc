== Access Redpanda services through VPC endpoint

After you have enabled Private Service Connect for your cluster, your connection URLs are available in the *How to Connect* section of the cluster overview in the Redpanda Cloud UI.

include::networking:partial$private-links-access-rp-services-through-vpc.adoc[]

== Test the connection

You can test the Private Service Connect connection from any VM or container in the consumer VPC. If configuring a client isn't possible right away, you can do these checks using `rpk` or curl:

== Disable Private Service Connect

Make a xref:api:ROOT:cloud-controlplane-api.adoc#patch-/v1/clusters/-cluster.id-[`PATCH /v1/clusters/{cluster.id}`] request to update the cluster to disable Private Service Connect.
