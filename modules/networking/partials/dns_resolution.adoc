PrivateLink changes how DNS resolution works for your cluster. When you query cluster hostnames outside the VPC/subnet DNS path that contains your PrivateLink endpoint, DNS may return private IP addresses that aren't reachable from your location.

To resolve cluster hostnames from anywhere in your VPC (or through centralized DNS), configure DNS forwarding for your cluster's domain to the Amazon-provided DNS resolver.

* *Cluster domain*: The suffix after the seed hostname.
+
For example, if your bootstrap server URL is: `seed-3da65a4a.cki01qgth38kk81ard3g.byoc.dev.cloud.redpanda.com:9092`, then `cluster_domain` is: `cki01qgth38kk81ard3g.byoc.dev.cloud.redpanda.com`.

* *Amazon-provided DNS*: Located at VPC base CIDR + 2.
+
For example, if your VPC CIDR is `10.30.0.0/16`, then the DNS resolver is at `10.30.0.2`.

For cross-VPC or on-premises setups:

. In the VPC that contains your PrivateLink endpoint, create a Route 53 Resolver inbound endpoint.
. In each other VPC that must resolve the cluster domain, create a Resolver outbound endpoint and a forwarding rule for `<cluster_domain>` with targets = the inbound endpoint IPs from the previous step. Associate the rule to those VPCs.
. For on-premises DNS, create a conditional forwarder for `<cluster_domain>` that forwards to the inbound endpoint IPs from the earlier step (over VPN/DX).

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not point Route 53 forwarding rules at the VPC's Amazon-provided DNS (VPC base + 2). The rule must target the IP addresses of resolvers, typically the inbound endpoint IPs.
